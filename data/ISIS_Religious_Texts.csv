Dabiq,1,Jun-14,Jihadist,Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,"O Muslims everywhere, glad tidings to you and expect good. Raise your head high, for today – by Allah’s grace – you have a state and Khilafah, which will return your dignity, might, rights, and leadership. It is a state where the Arab and non-Arab, the white man and black man, the easterner and westerner are all brothers. It is a Khilafah that gathered the Caucasian, Indian, Chinese, Shami, Iraqi, Yemeni, Egyptian, Maghribi (North African), American, French, German, and Australian. Allah brought their hearts together, and thus, they became brothers by His grace, loving each other for the sake of Allah, standing in a single trench, defending and guarding each other, and sacrificing themselves for one another. Their blood mixed and became one, under a single flag and goal, in one pavilion, enjoying this blessing, the blessing of faithful brotherhood. If kings were to taste this blessing, they would abandon their kingdoms and fight over this grace. So all praise and thanks are due to Allah. Soon, by Allah’s permission, a day will come when the Muslim will walk everywhere as a master, having honor, being revered, with his head raised high and his dignity preserved. Anyone who dares to offend him will be disciplined, and any hand that reaches out to harm him will be cut off. So let the world know that we are living today in a new era. Whoever was heedless must now be alert. Whoever was sleeping must now awaken. Whoever was shocked and amazed must comprehend. The Muslims today have a loud, thundering statement, and possess heavy boots. They have a statement to make that will cause the world to hear and understand the meaning of terrorism, and boots that will trample the idol of nationalism, destroy the idol of democracy, and uncover its deviant nature. The time has come for those generations that were drowning in oceans of disgrace, being nursed on the milk of humiliation, and being ruled by the vilest of all people, after their long slumber in the darkness of neglect – the time has come for them to rise. The time has come for the Ummah of Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) to wake up from its sleep, remove the garments of dishonor, and shake off the dust of humiliation and disgrace, for the era of lamenting and moaning has gone, and the dawn of honor has emerged anew.

As for the sinful, unjust, immoral tyrant, then such an individual doesn’t qualify for this position on account of the statement of Allah, {My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.} It was for this reason that Ibn Az-Zubayr and AlHusayn Ibn Ali revolted. Likewise, the best of the people of Iraq and their scholars revolted against Al-Hajjaj, and the people of Madinah expelled the tribe Bani Umayyah from Madinah and then revolted against them (the Umayyad ruler), resulting in (the massacre of) Al-Harrah which Muslim Ibn Uqbah brought down on them.

Dabiq,1,Jun-14,Tafsir,Tafsir Ibn Kathir,"Ibn Kathir (rahimahullah) states, His (subhanahu wa ta’ala) statement: {with certain kalimat}, means with laws, commands, and prohibitions. The term kalimat can be used to refer to statements concerning the qadar (divine decree) of Allah. An example of this is the statement of Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) about Maryam, {and she believed in the kalimat (words) of her Lord and His scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient} [At-Tahrim: 12]. It can also be used in a shar’i context, as in the statement of Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala), {And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can alter His kalimat (words)} [Al-An’am: 115], meaning His shar’i kalimat, which include things that Allah informs us of and commands that He requires us to obey. An example of the shar’i usage of the term kalimat is the noble verse in discussion, {And (remember) when Ibrahim was tried by his Lord with certain kalimat and he fulfilled them}, meaning he carried them out. {(Allah) said, Indeed, I will make you a leader for mankind.’}, meaning as a reward for his actions.

Likewise, the patience he displayed – as terrifying as it was – when Namrud threw him into the fire and he was about to be burned alive for the sake of Allah.

Unacknowledged by the world community, ISIS has carved a de facto state in the borderlands of Syria and Iraq. Stretching in a long ellipse roughly from al-Raqqah in Syria to Fallujah in Iraq (with many other noncontiguous islands of control in both Iraq and Syria), this former Al Qaeda affiliate holds territory, provides limited services, dispenses a form of justice (loosely defined), most definitely has an army, and flies its own flag. ...

Dabiq,2,Jul-14,Tafsir,At-Tibyan fi Aqsam al-Quran,"Ibnul-Qayyim (rahimahull?h) said, I will mention a debate that occurred between me and some jews. I said to one of them – after he had denied the prophethood of the Prophet, Your denial of his prophethood entails slandering the Lord of the universe, belittling Him, and attributing to Him the worst of all blemishes. Before the discussion with you was about the Messenger and now it is about the Lord ta’?l? being free of all imperfections.’ He said, How can you say such?’ So I said to him, Clarifying such is my responsibility, so listen now. You claim that he was not a messenger rather he was a conqueror king who conquered the people by his sword until they yielded to him. And he spent 23 years lying against Allah and saying, I was revealed to,’ and he was not revealed to. He commanded me,’ and He did not command him. He forbade me [from doUnderstanding The Hikmah in Allah’s Actions ing something],’ and He did not forbid him. Allah said such and such,’ and He did not say such. He made such and such hal?l, such and such har?m, such and such w?jib, and such and such makr?h,’ and He did not make any of such hal?l nor har?m nor w?jib, rather he did these things on his own by lying and fabricating things against Allah, His prophets, and His angels. Thereafter he spent 23 years apathetically killing His slaves, spilling their blood, taking their wealth, enslaving their women and children, while they had no sin save rejection of and opposition to him, and throughout all this he says, Allah ordered me with this,’ and Allah did not order him. And in addition to this, he endeavors to change the religions of the messengers, abrogate their laws, and undue their traditions. This is his condition in your view. So either the Lord ta’?l? knows about this, hears of it and his condition, sees and witnesses him, or not. So if you claim that all this is away from Allah, and He did not know of it, then you have slandered the Lord ta’?l? and attributed extreme ignorance to Him, since He did not hear of this great event, nor know of it, nor see it. And if you claim that rather this occurred with His knowledge, awareness, and under His vision, you will be asked if He was able to change such, hold him back, and prevent him, or not. If you say that He was incapable of such, you have attributed weakness to Him and negated His rub?biyyah, thereby this human along with his followers were more capable of achieving their desires. And if you say that rather He was capable but He consolidated him, supported him, gave him mastery over the creation, and did not support His awliy?’ and the followers of His messengers, then you have attributed to Him the worst of foolishness, oppression, and lack of wisdom. That would be the case if He merely allowed him to do what he did. So what if He Himself was his support, the answerer of his supplications, the destroyer of those opposing and contradicting him, the confirmer of his claim with many forms of sanction, and the revealer of signs upon his hands – signs that if the people of the earth were all to gather and work together, they would not be able to produce just one of such signs and would fail in doing so. And at every moment He creates for him causes of victory, consolidation, ascension, and abundance of followers, in a manner that is abnormal? Therefore it becomes clear that the one who denies him to be a messenger and prophet has indeed cursed Allah, slandered Him, and attributed ignorance, weakness, and foolishness to Him!’ I then said to him, This is not contradicted by the oppressive kings that Allah granted with consolidation upon the earth for a period of time and then He destroyed their existence, annihilated their traditions, and erased their traces and tyranny, for they had not practiced any of this, nor were they aided and supported. Nor did signs appear at their hands. Nor did the Lord ta’?l? confirm them with His consent, actions, or speech. Rather their condition was like Pharaoh, Nimrod, and their likes – opposite of that of the Messenger. This is also not contradicted by the claimants of prophethood from amongst the liars. Rather their condition is opposite of that of the Messenger from every angle. Instead, their condition was from the clearest of proofs confirming the truthfulness of the Messenger. It was from the wisdom of Allah (subh?nah) that the likes of these came out to existence so that the condition of the liars became apparent and distinct from that of the truthful. Therefore, their appearance was from the clearest of proofs for the truthfulness of the messengers and showed the difference between these liars and the messengers, because things become clear when their opposites appear. And the good of something is shown by its opposite. Thus, awareness of the doubts used to argue falsehood directs one to the truth and its proofs.’ He then said, I seek refuge with Allah.

Bush enabled the spreading of Persian (Iranian) influence over Afghanistan after it had been a tough obstacle for the Persians. He seconded with Iraq and opened up its treasures for them while they had not dreamt of drinking a sip of its water. And now they suck up its oil, loot its treasures, and enslave its men. Third, he panicked its r?fid? nusayr? tyrant – through an embargo upon Syria – into opening his country up to hundreds rather thousands of the Persians to nationalize themselves there and become supporters for the agent of the anti-Christ Nasrull?t who is called Nasr Allah’ and who just emerged from a so-called victory against the pinnacle of the Roman military machine (the Israeli military). And thus, the ancient Persian empire completed and expanded from Mawarannahr (Transoxiana) to Iran then through Iraq – the location of al-Mada’in (the imperial capital of Persia) – ending in Sh?m (Syria/Lebanon/Palestine).

Dabiq,4,Sep-14,"Media, Politician, or Analyst",Michael Scheuer,"For now, however, the beginning of wisdom is to look at what is going on in Iraq and Syria and see it clearly. In both places all of those folks that multiple US administrations have identified as enemies of America are killing each other. In Syria, the Assad regime, Iran, and Lebanese Hizballah are killing Sunni mujahedin from all over the world, as well as their local allies and supporters. In turn, the Sunni Islamists in Syria are killing Assad’s troops, Iranian Revolutionary Guards, and Hizballah fighters. This is a perfect circumstance for the United States, all our enemies are killing each other and it is not costing us a cent or a life. Over in Iraq, we see much the same marvelous phenomena occurring. Multinational Sunni mujahedin and Saddam’s former military personnel are fighting and killing Maliki’s dictatorial regime, its Shia military forces, and their Iranian military supporters. And, as in Syria, Maliki and his gang are killing our Sunni Islamist enemies. In Iraq there also is the potential for a delightful bonus coming to fruition. If the United States stays out of the affair, the renewed war in Iraq may trigger a widespread Shia-vs-Sunni civil war in which our Muslim enemies – as they are defined by our bipartisan political elite – may begin to kill each other for a prolonged period and at unprecedented levels, and, again, at no cost to us in lives or dollars. So let us take both a deep breath and Lt. Col. Peters advice and sit back and watch what is going on in Syria and Iraq with equanimity and absolutely from the sidelines. Cheer for neither side, answer no one’s call for help – especially not one from the near-frantic Neocons who now know they sank their beloved Israel with the 2003 invasion of Iraq – and pray that Obama does not cooperate with Iran to restore Maliki’s Shia tyranny and thereby earn the eternal enmity of all of the Sunni world.

But destroying ISIS, even in a couple of years, is just not possible. If we succeed in dismantling ISIS, we’re still left with a really problematic region. Robinson: This kind of partnered counterterrorism approach that the president has been talking about requires really refining how America deals with its partners. In this case, every partner is problematic. Iraqi security forces have crumbled in recent months. The Shia militias are problematic. The Sunnis could potentially turn against ISIS, but they are very wary of this new government. The Peshmurgas, the Kurdish militia, are least problematic. Finally, the Syrian opposition is terribly weak. Connable: I’m not sure anybody has a clear understanding of who’s who in Syria. Identities and loyalties shift. I don’t think it’s going to cripple the strategy, but it is a serious hurdle. The absence of a clearly envisioned end state condition is important. What is it that we want this group that we’re going to support to do after ISIS is defeated? The Free Syrian Army is the group we go to now. They’ve suffered battlefield defeats. They’re politically disorganized. I’m not sure what they would do with the Syrian state if they were able to assume control. Liepman: We need to remind ourselves that the president said, as did his military commanders, that this new phase of fighting against a determined and impressive enemy, will take some time. We need to be careful about how we define victory. We won’t vanquish this enemy. We’ll be lucky to degrade ISIS. We need patience. Rabasa: I’m afraid we may have fallen into ISIS’s trap. We probably had no choice but to extend the airstrikes into Syria, since that is ISIS’s base of operations. But by doing so we have escalated the campaign against ISIS without deploying sufficient force to seriously degrade or destroy them. Rabasa: Airstrikes will have diminishing returns as ISIS adjusts.

And we do not know of any group from amongst the Muslims who are less in speech than the people of Yemen or are less argumentative than them, whether from the early or later generations. Thus, he indicated that the knowledge and fiqh praised by Allah is the knowledge of Allah that leads one to love Him and be loved by Him, and to honor and revere Him, along with the knowledge that one requires of His commands and prohibitions. This was the case with the scholars of Yemen in the past, such as Ab? M?s? al-Ash’ar?, Ab? Muslim al-Khawl?n?, Uways al-Qaran? and others, without getting into any thing beyond that knowledge such as pitting the statements of the people against each other and excessively searching for their faults and slip-ups […] as well as excessively searching for the unnecessary aspects of sciences that do not benefit one’s religious adherence, that serve to distract one from Allah and from being preoccupied with Him, that harden one’s heart towards His dhikr, and that cause the experts of such sciences to desire a high position and leadership of the people. None of this is praiseworthy, and indeed the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) used to seek refuge from knowledge that does not benefit [Reported by Muslim on the authority of Zayd]. In a had?th reported from him he said, Ask Allah for beneficial knowledge and seek refuge with Allah from knowledge that does not benefit’ [Reported by Ibn M?jah on the authority of J?bir].

Dabiq,7,Jan-15,Salaf,Abu Bakr as-Siddiq,"From Ab? Bakr, the Khal?fah of Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam); To whomever this letter reaches of the general public and individual figures, whether they have remained upon their Islam or turned back from it; Peace be upon those who follow the right guidance and have not turned back from the right guidance to deviance and blindness. I praise to you Allah, other than whom there is no god. And I testify that there is no god but Allah alone, who has no partner. And I testify that Muhammad is His slave and messenger. We affirm what he came with, pronounce takf?r upon those who refuse this affirmation, and wage jih?d against them. As for what follows: Indeed, Allah sent Muhammad with the truth from Him to His creation as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, a caller to Allah, and an illuminating lamp, to warn whoever is alive and establish the proof against the k?fir?n. Allah then guided by the truth whoever answered him, and Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) struck those who turned away from Him by His permission, until they entered Islam either willingly or grudgingly. Then Allah took His Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) after he had carried out Allah’s order, sincerely advised his Ummah, and fulfilled what he was responsible for. Allah had clarified this to him and the people of Islam in the revealed book. He said, {Indeed, you are to die, and indeed, they are to die} [AzZumar: 30]. He also said, {And We did not grant to any man before you eternity, so if you die – would they be eternal?} [Al-Anbiy?’: 34]. He also said to the believers, {Muhammad is not but a messenger. Messengers have passed on before him. So if he were to die or be killed, would you turn back on your heels? And he who turns back on his heels will never harm Allah at all; and Allah will reward the grateful} [?l Imr?n: 144]. So whoever worships Muhammad, then let him know that Muhammad has died. And whoever worships Allah alone, who has no partner, then let him know that Allah is ever watchful of him. He is living and eternal; He does not die. Neither tiredness nor sleep overtakes Him. He guards His religion and exacts revenge upon His enemy. I advise you with taqw? of Allah, your duty towards Allah, and what your Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) came with. And I advise you to take as guidance his guidance and grasp the religion of Allah, for anyone whom Allah does not guide is deviant, anyone whom He does not decree wellbeing for is afflicted, and anyone whom Allah does not aid is abandoned. So whomever Allah guides is guided and whomever He leaves astray is deviant. Allah (ta’?l?) said, {He whom Allah guides is the guided, but he whom He leaves astray – never will you find for him a protecting guide} [Al-Kahf: 17], and no deed will be accepted from him in the Duny? until he accepts Him. no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him in the Hereafter. It has reached me that some of you turned back from their religion after accepting Islam and acting in accordance with it, out of delusion about Allah, ignorance of His affair, and in response to Shayt?n. Allah (ta’?l?) said, {And [mention] when We said to the angels, Prostrate to ?dam, and they prostrated, except for Ibl?s. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange} [Al-Kahf: 50]. And He said, {Indeed, Shayt?n is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy. He only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze} [F?tir: 6]. I have sent to you so and so [Kh?lid Ibn al-Wal?d] with an army of the Muh?jir?n, the Ans?r, and their good followers, and I’ve ordered him to not fight anyone or kill anyone until he calls him to the call of Allah.

Whoever follows it, then it is best for him. And whoever leaves it, then he cannot incapacitate Allah. I’ve ordered my envoy to read this message in every gathering of yours and the signal is the adh?n. [I’ve said to my army] if the Muslims perform adh?n and they [the apostates] do not perform adh?n, then rush to kill them.

Dabiq,7,Jan-15,Classical Scholar,Ibn Taymiyyah,"I mentioned before in previously discussed principles that Islam – the religion of Allah with which He revealed His books and sent His messengers – is that the slave yuslim (submits) to Allah, the Lord of the creation, and thus, he yastaslim (submits) to Allah alone without giving Him partners and that he be s?lim (purely) for Him, in that he worships Him while not worshipping other than Him, as is made clear by the best word and the head of Islam l? il?ha illall?h. And it has two opposites: kibr and shirk. For this reason, it was reported that N?h (alayhis-sal?m) ordered his children with l? il?ha illall?h and subh?nall?h and forbade them from kibr and shirk [Reported by Im?m Ahmad on the authority of Abdull?h Ibn Amr], as in a hadith I mentioned elsewhere. Indeed, the one who abstains due to arrogance from worshipping Allah does not worship Him, so he is not mustaslim (submitting) to Him, and he who worships Him and worships others with Him is a mushrik towards Him, so he is not s?lim for Him, rather he has shirk towards Him. The word Islam includes the two meanings, istisl?m (submission) and sal?mah which is sincerity. And it is known that all the messengers were sent with the general Islam consisting of this [Al-?m?n al-Awsat]. He (rahimahull?h) also said: The word Islam’ can be used in two ways, transitively, as in His statement, {And who is better in religion than one who aslama (submits) himself to Allah while being a doer of good} [AnNis?’: 125], and His statement, {I have aslamtu (submitted) myself to Allah, and so have those who follow me. And say to those who were given the Scripture and to the unlearned, Have you aslamtum (submitted)? And if they aslam? (submit), they are rightly guided; but if they turn away – then upon you is only the duty of notification. And Allah is Seeing of the servants} [?l Imr?n: 20], and his statement (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) in the du’?’ before sleep, I aslamtu (have submitted) myself to You’ [Reported by al-Bukh?r? and Muslim on the authority of al-Bar?’ Ibn ?zib]. It is also used intransitively, as in His statement, {When his Lord said to him, aslim (submit), he said I aslamtu (have submitted) to the Lord of the worlds} [Al-Baqarah: 131]. And it encompasses two meanings, the first is obedience and submission; the second is dedicating that sincerely to Him alone, as in His statement, {Allah presents an example: a slave owned by quarreling partners and another salam (purely) for one man – are they equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know} [Az-Zumar: 29]. Its incarnation is the statement l? il?ha illall?h",Support,Islam is the Religion of the Sword Not Pacifism
Dabiq,7,Jan-15,Hadith,Sahih Muslim,"Rather Islam is istisl?m (submission) to Allah alone. The word Islam entails istisl?m and dedicating such sincerely to Allah. More than one scholar has mentioned this including the specialists in Arabic such as Ab? Bakr Ibn alAnb?r? and others. Some of the commentators have considered these two meanings to be two different interpretations, as a group of them including al-Baghaw? said, The Muslim is the mustaslim (submitter) to Allah. It has also been said he is the mukhlis (sincere one).’ The reality is that the Muslim is he who gathers both meanings in himself, for whoever does not yastaslim (submit) to Him, is not a Muslim, and whoever istaslam (submitted) to other than Him as he does for Him, is not a Muslim. Whoever istaslam (submitted) to Him alone is a Muslim, as in the Qur’?n, {Yes, whoever aslama (submits) his face to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve} [Al-Baqarah: 112] [An-Nub?w?t].6 It is clear then that sal?m (peace) is not the basis of the word Islam, although it shares the same consonant root (s-l-m) and is one of the outcomes of the religion’s sword, as the sword will continue to be drawn, raised, and swung until ?s? (Jesus – alayhis-sal?m) kills the Dajj?l (the Antichrist) and abolishes the jizyah. Thereafter, kufr and its tyranny will be destroyed; Islam and its justice will prevail on the entire Earth.

Dabiq,7,Jan-15,"Media, Politician, or Analyst",Patrick Cockburn,"Isis is surviving attempts to defeat it and holds about the same amount of territory in Iraq and Syria – an area larger than Great Britain – as it did at the end of its blitzkrieg offensives last year. Its enemies are numerous, but disunited and without a common plan. Neither the Iraqi nor the Syrian armies, its chief military opponents, are strong enough to over-run the jihadi state.So long as Isis continues to exist, it retains the capacity to dominate the political and media agenda for days at a time by threatening the public execution of hostages. These grizzly events, as we have seen with the Japanese and Jordanian hostages, are stage managed in order to gain maximum publicity and inspire general terror. Isis has suffered setbacks, but has also had successes. This week, its forces were finally driven out of the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani after a siege lasting 134 days, in which it suffered heavy losses from 606 US air strikes. But elsewhere in Syria, Isis has been advancing towards the city of Homs as well as gaining strength south of Damascus and at alQalamoun, close to eastern Lebanon. By one account, Isis has won control of territory since last September where one million Syrians live, in addition to the area it already held. In Iraq, government forces have made advances in the provinces around Baghdad, but earlier this week bullets hit a plane and wounded passengers over Baghdad International Airport, forcing major airlines to stop flying there. This isolates the Iraqi capital and, though the airport is not completely closed, Isis could probably achieve this at any moment. He then went on to say: According to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, the number of foreign fighters joining Isis in Iraq and Syria has risen from 15,000 last October to 20,000 today. A fifth of these come from Western Europe. Isis has also conscripted fighters in the territories it controls. Isis is being squeezed militarily and economically, but there is no sign of it imploding. Even its loss of Kobani is not necessarily a sign of weakness, since it held on for months despite fighting … [the] Syrian Kurds, backed by an intensive US air bombardment in a confined place. Western analysts are encouraged by the number of experienced Isis commanders killed last year, but its ideology is built around martyrdom, and the high casualty rate among leaders shows that they fight in the frontline. President Obama says America’s main effort is in Iraq but unless it can rebuild the Iraqi army then it will be near impossible to defeat Isis there.

M?s? (radiyall?hu anh), and say, O Ras?lull?h, what is fighting f? sab?lill?h? One of us might fight out of ghadab (anger) or fight out of hamiyyah (zeal).’ So the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) lifted his head towards him and said, Whoever fights so that the word of Allah becomes supreme, then he has fought f? sab?lill?h (azza wa jall).’ An-Nawaw?, Ibn Hajar, and others said that hamiyyah is to fight out of pride, jealousy, or in defense of the clan. Rather, al-H?fidh Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath,’ It is possible that fighting out of hamiyyah could mean fighting to repel a harm and that fighting out of ghadab could mean fighting to attain a benefit.’ So has your fighting, O people, gone beyond what the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) warned against? Rather, it is the full extent of your purpose, whereas what is demanded by Allah’s Shar?’ah is just as al-H?fidh Ibn Hajar said in AlFath,’ Fighting is not f? sab?lill?h unless the only purpose of his fighting is to make Allah’s word supreme.’ Liberating the nation and other goals enter into this as a consequence but not as the purpose. You have known the harm in this form of fighting, as most of the Arab rulers today came to power after wars under the banners of nationalism. How do you see the outcome?

Dabiq,8,Mar-15,Jihadist,Abu Umar al-Baghdadi,"Am?rul-Mu’min?n Ab? Umar al-Baghd?d? (rahimahull?h) said, The idea of nationalism and patriotism contradicts the religion in a number of its fundamentals. First, preferring people to others is in accordance with their piety not their blood. Allah (ta’?l?) said, {O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and dabiq 7 8 ARTICLE THE ALLIES OF AL-Q?’IDAH IN SH?M made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you} [Al-Hujur?t: 13]. Second, it contradicts the creed of wal?’ and bar?’ – a great fundamental of the religion – and uproots it. The Arab Iraqi Christian is their brother who has all rights whereas the Indian or Turkish Muslim has no rights. The Shar?’ah of these people necessitates preferring Uqbah Ibn Ab? Mu’ayt and Ab? Jahl to Bil?l the Ethiopian and Salm?n the Persian. Third, it opposes the bond between the believers. Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alahyi wa sallam) said, The believer to the believer is like a building, each part holding up the other’ [Reported by al-Bukh?r? and Muslim on the authority of Ab?

Allah (ta’?l?) said, {When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts hamiyyah – the hamiyyah of J?hiliyyah} [Al-Fath: 26].

They called abandonment of the obligations a sin just like any other sin, although they are not equal, for committing sins without istihl?l (considering the sin to be hal?l) is merely sinful, whereas abandoning the obligations consciously without ignorance or excuse is kufr. What clarifies this is the matter of ?dam (alayhis-sal?m), Ibl?s, and the Jewish rabbis. As for ?dam, then Allah (azza wa jall) forbade him from eating from the Tree and made it har?m for him, but he consciously ate from it to become an angel or become immortal, so he was called disobedient without kufr. As for Ibl?s (may Allah curse him), then Allah obligated upon him a single prostration but he consciously refused it, so he was called a k?fir. As for the Jewish rabbis, then they knew the description of the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) and that he was a prophet and messenger, just as they knew their own children, and they acknowledged this with their tongues, but they did not follow his Shar?’ah, so Allah (azza wa jall) called them kuff?r.

Dabiq,14,Apr-16,Jihadist,Abu Mus'ab as-Suri,"As-S?r? said, As for the practitioners of democracy, then they are of different types. Thus, the rule upon them differs. But in general, I believe in the opinion that says that those who believe the philosophy and legislations of democracy to be kufr and contrary to the creed of Islam and religion of tawh?d but practice it under the pretense of being weak and it being the only available means to achieve interests they believe to serve the da’wah, Islam, and the Muslims and that it is the viable way to reach the implementation of the Shar?’ah in these circumstances and abolish what opposes the Shar?’ah, or that it is the potential path to declare the truth, command the good, forbid the evil, and pass the voice of truth to the Ummah, and so forth, then the sincere people amongst them are excused in their practice of democracy and joining of its institutions due to their wrong misunderstanding [Da’wat al-Muq?wamah]! As-S?r? said, The Jih?d? Creed and the Constitution of the International Islamic Resistance Call: … Article 19: The international Islamic call considers the efforts of all the sincere ones within the Islamic awakening – the da’wah, reform, educational, religious, and other efforts approved of by the Shar?’ah – that the various schools of the Islamic awakening practice including…the Muslim Brotherhood…to be deserving of gratitude due to their preservation of the Muslims’ religion and improvement of their conditions. It calls them to cooperate in righteousness and piety and to support the resistance. It considers their efforts in da’wah to Allah’s religion to be a support for and solidification of the roots of resistance within this Ummah and a preservation of its composition. It calls everyone to overlook the points of difference at this stage in which the existence of all Muslims is at threat on all cultural levels [Da’wat al-Muq?wamah]. As-S?r? said, Harmful matters manifested in the works of at-Tal?’ah. That was their inclination – especially Adn?n Uqlah and some of his students – towards extremism, particularly after the Ikhw?n took the odd path of the coalition and a new political media campaign, after the Ikhw?n had solidified Adn?n’s stance by their insistence on boycotting at-Tal?’ah and holding enmity towards it. So Adn?n Uqlah declared his takf?r of those leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood…that approved of the National Coalition [of the eighties] and what it entailed of corruption. What pushed him to this was some of the truly corrupt publications of the National Coalition, which obviously included the Ikhw?n! … And despite a number of reasonable figures standing in the face of this extreme path of takf?r of others, Adn?n stuck to his conviction while having plausible claims that he would repeat regularly. He was followed by numerous members of at-Tal?’ah on his opinion [At-Thawrah al-Isl?miyyah al-Jih?diyyah f? S?riy?]. He also described one of the negative points in the experience of at-Tal?’ah as being, The inclination of at-Tal?’ah towards extremism in its last days as a result of the Ikhw?n? and Iraqi boycott, the conspiracy of all parties against it, and what it clearly faced of oppression and violence. This extremism was a constant trait of everyone who belonged to at-Tal?’ah. The Ikhw?n? media played a major role in exaggerating this extremism to use it against at-Tal?’ah, but undoubtedly at-Tal?’ah had some obvious extremism. Probably the most extreme of what it delved into was the conviction that Adn?n Uqlah and some of his companions reached in pronouncing takf?r upon those of the Muslim Brotherhood…who gave verdicts in support of the National Coalition and approved of it as an idea and program. He would pronounce takf?r upon everyone to whom the condition of the coalition was proved and then insisted upon his loyalty to the leadership and its coalition. Adn?n Uqlah had some claims for his conviction found in the publications of the coalition and the statements of some of the Ikhw?n, especially Adn?n Sa’d ad-D?n, who said in one of his interviews that he considered the members of the Iraqi Baath party – the rightwing Aflaq party – to be Muslims and its leadership to be religious. Rather, Sa’d ad-D?n declared on more than one occasion his conviction that Saddam Hussein is Muslim and his regime is Islamic! Rather, Sa’d ad-D?n even criticized those youth who described Saddam with kufr and requested these youth repent from such beliefs. Still, despite these statements giving claim for Adn?n Uqlah’s conviction, undoubtedly the generalization he adopted was extreme! [At-Thawrah al-Isl?miyyah al-Jih?diyyah f?

After Washington killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, it made Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda’s new leader, its next number one target. But the instability in the Middle East following the Arab revolutions and the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and alSham (ISIS) require that Washington rethink its policy toward al Qaeda, particularly its targeting of Zawahiri. Destabilizing al Qaeda at this time may in fact work against US efforts to defeat ISIS. … Today, al Qaeda, although still a grave threat, is only one of several emanating from the Middle East. Washington must not only contain Iran’s hegemonic aspirations, which threaten US allies, but also fight ISIS’ expansion. Washington’s failure to balance these diverging interests became apparent when it made the mistake of coupling the bombing of ISIS targets in Syria with attacks on al Qaeda’s Khorasan group … In order for US President Barack Obama to fulfill his promise to degrade and ultimately destroy’ ISIS, he must weaken ISIS’ control of Mosul, Raqqa, and other large population centers, as well as stop its expansion. Inadvertently, the administration’s cautious approach to military intervention makes al Qaeda – which views ISIS as a renegade offshoot – an important player in curtailing ISIS’ growth. … As long as Zawahiri is alive, the leaders of al Qaeda’s branches who are beholden to him by personal oath are less likely to shift allegiances and join ISIS. But if and when Washington succeeds in killing Zawahiri, the leaders of al Qaeda’s branches would have the opportunity to reassess whether to remain with al Qaeda or join Baghdadi’s caliphate … More so than during the bin Laden era, al Qaeda’s cohesiveness depends on the ability of its leadership to hold the various franchises together, and it is unclear whether al Qaeda can endure another succession since al Qaeda’s veteran leaders have dwindled considerably in recent years, making it more dependent on old guard figures such as Zawahiri to maintain unity. As such, the group’s fate may depend on Zawahiri’s personal survival. It is certainly ironic that at this point, when the United States is the closest it has ever been to destroying al Qaeda, its interests would be better served by keeping the terrorist organization afloat and Zawahiri alive.",Refute,In the Words of the Enemy

Dabiq,10,Jun-15,Classical Scholar,Ibn Taymiyyah,"Shaykhul-Isl?m Ibn Taymiyyah r was asked about the ruling upon the Nusayriyyah and the Druze and answered, The Druze and the Nusayriyyah are kuff?r according to the agreement of the Muslims. It is not permissible to eat what they slaughter nor marry their women. Rather, they cannot be acknowledged with jizyah, for they are apostates from the religion of Islam, not Muslims, nor Jews, nor Christians. They do not recognize the obligation of the five daily prayers, nor the obligation of the Ramad?n fast, nor the obligation of hajj, nor the prohibition of what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited of dead animals, alcohol, and so on. And if they manifest the two testimonies of faith [there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger] alongside these tenets of creed, then they are kuff?r according to the agreement of the Muslims. … As for the Druze, then they are the followers of Hashtak?n ad-Darz? who was one of the followers of alH?kim [the apostate Ubayd? ruler]. Al-H?kim sent him to the people of the valley of Taymull?h Ibn Tha’labah and called them to believe in the godhood of al-H?kim. They call him al-B?r? al-All?m’ [The Creator, the All-Knowing] and swear by him. They are from the Ism?’?liyyah who claim that Muhammad Ibn Ism?’?l abrogated the Shar?’ah of Muhammad Ibn Abdill?h g. They are worse in kufr than the extreme Sh?’ah. They claim that the world existed eternally and deny the obligations and prohibitions of Islam. They are from the B?tin? Qar?mitah [those who claim the religion has secret meanings contradicting its apparent meanings] who are worse in kufr than the Jews, the Christians, and the pagan Arabs. They ultimately strive to be philosophers upon the doctrine of Aristotle and his likes or the Maj?s. Their doctrine is a combination of the doctrines of the philosophers and the Maj?s. They hypocritically manifest Shiism He r also said describing the Druze, The kufr of these people is a matter over which the Muslims do not differ. Rather whoever doubts their kufr is a k?fir like them. They are not at the level of Ahlul-Kit?b nor the mushrik?n. Rather, they are from the most deviant kuff?r, and so the meat they slaughter is not hal?l. Their women can be taken as slaves and their property can be seized. They are apostate heretics whose repentance cannot be accepted.2 Rather they are to be killed wherever they are found and cursed as they were described. It is not permissible to use them as guards, gatekeepers, or custodians. It is obligatory to kill their scholars and religious figures so that they do not misguide others. It is prohibited to sleep at their homes, accompany them, walk with them, or follow their funeral processions if their deaths are known. It is prohibited for the Muslims’ authorities to abandon the order of Allah by not executing the hud?d upon them He r also said describing the B?tiniyyah (which include the Druze), If these people are overcome, they manifest repentance because the basis of their doctrine is taqiyyah and concealment of their condition. Amongst them are those who will be known and amongst them are those who might not become known. So the best way to deal with them is to be cautious concerning their matter. They should not be allowed to remain together, nor should they be allowed to carry arms, nor should they be allowed to become from the soldiers. They should be forced to abide by the laws of Islam, including the five daily prayers and recitation of the Qur’?n. There should remain amongst them those who will teach them the religion of Islam and they should be left with these teachers … And whoever is from the leaders of their deviance and manifests repentance should be expelled from their places and taken to the main lands of the Muslims where these sects have no manifest presence so that either Allah ? guides him or he dies upon his hypocrisy without harming the Muslims",Support,The Allies of Al-Qaidah in Sham: Part III
Dabiq,10,Jun-15,Fatwa,Shaykhul-Islam,"In another fatw? in which he mentioned the extreme kufr of the B?tiniyyah (who include the Druze and the Nusayriyyah) and their treacherous alliance with other kuff?r (the crusaders and the Tatars) against the Muslims, he said, Their harm upon the Ummah of Muhammad g is greater than the harm of the war-waging kuff?r like the kuff?r of the Tatars, the Franks [European crusaders], and others … There is no doubt that jih?d against these people and the implementation of the hud?d upon them are from the greatest acts of obedience and obligations. This is better than jih?d against those who do not fight the Muslims from the mushrik?n and AhlulKit?b, for the jih?d against these people is from the jih?d against the apostates. As-Sidd?q and the Companions began with the jih?d against the apostates before the jih?d against the kuff?r from Ahlul-Kit?b. The jih?d against them preserves what has been conquered from the Muslims’ lands and so no one who intends to fight against the Muslims can enter these lands. As for jih?d against those who have not fought us from the mushrik?n and Ahlul-Kit?b, then it is to further manifest the religion. And preserving assets is a priority over making gains. Also, their harm on the Muslims is greater than others’ harm. Rather, their harm is like the harm of those from the mushrik?n and Ahlul-Kit?b who fight the Muslims. Rather, their harm on the religion is greater than the harm of the combatants from the mushrik?n and Ahlul-Kit?b. So it is obligatory upon every Muslim to attempt to do as much as he is able of this obligation against them. It is not permissible for anyone to hide what he knows of their secrets. Rather, he must spread them and make them public so that the Muslims know the reality of their condition. It is not permissible for anyone to cooperate with them by allowing them to remain amongst the soldiers and state employees. It is not permissible for anyone to be silent about establishing what Allah and His Messenger ordered against them. It is not permissible for anyone to forbid the establishment of what Allah and His Messenger ordered against them.

Here, the Mother of the Believers ?’ishah Bint as-Sidd?q ? will continue the story for us.

And with their leaders is a set of manmade laws and a t?gh?t whom they setup in order to judge between people concerning their blood, their wealth, and other matters, with laws that oppose and go against the shar’? texts. If any issue arises, they look into it and judge by the manmade laws, and throw the book of Allah behind their backs. As for the issue of seeking help from them [meaning against other kuff?r], it is a matter in which there is a difference of opinion. The correct position, which the leading scholars are upon, is that it is completely prohibited. Their evidence is the had?th narrated by ?’ishah (radiyall?hu anh?) which is agreed upon by al-Bukh?r? and Muslim, and the had?th narrated by Abdur-Rahm?n Ibn Hab?b which is authentic and marf?’. Look for them and you will find them in the texts you have with you. Those who say it is permissible use as evidence a mursal from az-Zuhr?, and you know how mursal narrations are treated when they contradict the Qur’an and Sunnah. Furthermore, those who say it is permissible place some conditions: that it should be done for the good of the Muslims and the desire to benefit them, whereas in this case it contains destruction and devastation for them. They also stipulate that the mushrik?n should not have a fearful degree of power and authority, and this invalidates your position in this particular case. They also stipulate that the mushrik should not have any influence in opinion and decisionmaking, which is the opposite of what is taking place in this case. All this has been mentioned by the scholars of fiqh and the had?th commentators, and [ash-Shawk?n?] has mentioned this in Sharh al-Muntaq?’ [Naylul-Awt?r’] and has declared the mursal narration of az-Zuhr? very weak. And all this is regarding a mushrik fighting with the Muslims against another mushrik. As for a Muslim seeking the help of a mushrik against a b?gh? (outlaw), then no one has allowed this other than those who have strayed He also said on the same issue, The reality of the matter is more severe and far greater than the issue of merely seeking help and support. It is allying with them and removing the barrier protecting the people of Islam and tawh?d from them, removing the principles and fundamentals of Islam, shedding the blood of the Muslims, and violating their honor and wealth. This is the reality of the present situation. Because of this, open shirk and blatant kufr started to appear in the land to the extent that not even a trace of Islam remained to refer back to or depend on for salvation. How so, when the principles of tawh?d and ?m?n were destroyed, the rulings of the Qur’an and Sunnah were set aside, the first generations – from amongst the people of Badr and Bay’at ar-Ridw?n – were openly cursed, and shirk and R?fid?

These false S?f? gatherings, accursed sites, and structures built over the graves, along with the act of directing Allah’s rights to these graves, including du’?’, sacrifice, oaths, fear and hope, and asking them for that which should not be asked for except from Allah, as well as praying there, touching them with the hope of attaining blessings, offering gifts to them, and other such disgusting and hideous activities, all exist among you openly. And he who does not take part in such deeds is pleased with them, and he defends the people who do these deeds with his wealth, his tongue, and his hands. The five daily prayers are likewise abandoned, and most of your people do not attend the jumu’ah or congregational prayer, nor do they pray individually. And most of those amongst you who do pray, pray individually at home, and those who attend congregational prayer are few in number. When one of them attends the prayer, he comes out and finds the people in the markets, abandoning the prayer and immersed in sin, play, immorality, and wrongs, and he does not denounce them. The zak?h is likewise abandoned. It is not taken from the people’s wealth, nor are their crops counted, nor is the work of Allah’s Messenger ? in that regard undertaken, nor is the zak?h due on the crops collected, nor spent upon those designated as eligible recipients by Allah from above the seven heavens, as the Prophet ? said, Allah was not pleased with having the recipients of zak?h designated by a prophet or anyone else. Rather, He divided it Himself and took responsibility of designating its recipients with His statement, {Zak?h expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect zak?h and for bringing hearts together for Islam and for freeing captives or slaves and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the stranded traveler – an obligation imposed by Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Wise} [At-Tawbah: 60].’ Furthermore, you do not uphold any of the deeds of righteousness in addition to the pillars, nor do you command the people to practice them, whereas all sinful acts are openly committed among you and for most of you they have become part of your nature. This includes committing shirk with Allah, fornication, and sodomy – the deed of the people of L?t, the people of the overturned towns about whom Allah said, {And the overturned towns He hurled down, and covered them by that which He covered} [An-Najm: 53-54]. We seek protection with Allah the Mighty, and with His Noble Face, from his wrath and punishment. Likewise usury, sorcery, and claiming to have knowledge of the unseen, and all kinds of sins, including alcohol and other intoxicants, such as tobacco and its likes, prostitution, injustice, aggression, taking the wealth of the poor, the weak, the wealthy, and the farmers – you forcibly, aggressively, and unjustly take their wealth – and many other similar matters that are too many to count and would take too long to mention, are things that you do not denounce. And whoever claims that he does not commit any of these sins, then as we said earlier, he does not denounce them, nor does he abandon those who commit them. Rather, he supports them with his wealth and his tongue. So even if he doesn’t commit these sins, he and those who commit them are equal, as Allah ? said, {And it has already been revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them until they engage in a talk other than that; otherwise you would be like them} [An-Nis?’: 140]. And He ? said, {You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. Those – He has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with a spirit from Him} [Al-Muj?dilah: 22]. And He ? said, {And do not incline toward those who do wrong, lest you be touched by the Fire, and you would not have other than Allah any protectors; then you would not be helped} [H?d: 113]. And in the had?th, I have nothing to do with a Muslim living amongst the mushrik?n,’ and in another had?th, They should not be able to see each other’s fires.’ And you are aware of your deeds, and you are aware of the shirk and hideous deeds amongst you, and you know yourselves of this, as He ? said, {Rather, man, against himself, will be a witness, even if he presents his excuses} [Al-Qiy?mah: 14- 15]. He then continued, until he said, And what you mentioned of us killing the kuff?r, then this is a matter that we neither apologize for nor disregard. And we will do more in that regard, insh?’all?h, and we will advise our children to do likewise after us, and they will advise their children likewise after them, as the Companion said, We will remain upon jih?d, as long as we live.’ We will rub the noses of the kuff?r in dirt, shed their blood, and take their wealth as ghan?mah by the might and power of Allah. And we do all that in emulation of the Prophet ?, not innovating anything. We do it in obedience to Allah and His Messenger, and to come closer to Allah. And we hope to attain abundant rewards by this deed, as per His statement, {Then kill the mushrik?n wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zak?h, let them go on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful} [At-Tawbah: 5], and His statement, {And fight them until there is no fitnah and until the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease – then indeed, Allah is seeing of what they do. But if they turn away – then know that Allah is your protector. Excellent is the protector, and Excellent is the helper} [Al-Anf?l: 39-40], and His statement, {So when you meet those who disbelieve strike their necks} [Muhammad: 4], and His statement, {Fight them; Allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them} [At-Tawbah: 14]. We desire what is with Allah of abundant rewards, as Allah ? said, {Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah, so they kill and are killed. It is a true promise binding upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur’?n. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment} [At-Tawbah: 111]. And He ? said, {O you who have believed, shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment? It is that you believe in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if you should know. He will forgive for you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence. That is the great attainment. And you will obtain another favor that you love – victory from Allah and an imminent conquest; and give good tidings to the believers} [As-Saff: 10-13]. And the other verses and ah?d?th that talk about jih?d and encourage it cannot be counted. And we have no custom other than jih?d, and we have no source of sustenance other than the wealth of the kuff?r. He then continued, until he said, As for having a truce while you are upon other than Islam, then by Allah’s might and power, this is something impossible. And you know that this is a matter that you’ve requested from us again and again. You sent us Abdul-Az?z al-Qad?m?, and then you sent us Abdul-Az?z Beg, and you requested from us a truce and offered to pay jizyah in the amount of thirty thousand gold dinars every year, but we did not accept that from you and did not respond to your request for a truce. If you accept Islam, you will enjoy its goodness, and that is what we seek, and if you refuse then we say to you as Allah ? said, {But if they turn away, they are only in dissension, and Allah will be sufficient for you against them. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing} [Al-Baqarah: 137]. And we tell you, {Sufficient for us is Allah, and He is the best Disposer of affairs} [?l Imr?n: 173]. And we say, O {Sovereign of the Day of Recompense. It is You we worship and You we ask for help} [Al-F?tihah: 4-5]. And we say, {Truth has come, and falsehood has departed. Indeed is falsehood, by nature, ever bound to depart} [Al-Isr?’: 81]. And we say, {The truth has come, and falsehood can neither begin [anything] nor repeat [it]} [Saba’: 49]. And we say as Allah said to His Prophet, {But if they turn away, say, Sufficient for me is Allah; there is no god except Him. On Him I have relied, and He is the Lord of the Great Throne} [At-Tawbah: 129]. And as for what you mentioned of a treaty, then know that running away is not an act of men, and we keep ourselves above running away and lying. And we will reach you soon, insh?’all?h, when Allah brings us to you. So when you hear the cannon strikes and smell the gunpowder, and when you see fire in your lands, insh?’all?h, then don’t hold back your strength.

The area also witnessed exchanges of strikes between the two sides and the destruction of vehicles belonging to the Islamic State’ organization carried out by fighters of an-Nusrah and the other factions with the usage of American TOW missiles. The chairman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdulrahman said, This is the first time that the International Coalition supports the non- Kurdish opposition in the battles against the fighters of the Islamic State’ organization. He also said, These strikes constitute indirect support for Ahr?r ash-Sh?m and Jabhat an-Nusrah. (He forgets the calls made out to the Crusader Coalition by leaders in Ahr?r ash-Sh?m and the Sh?miyyah Front via satellite television and internet tweets.)

Dabiq,10,Jun-15,"Media, Politician, or Analyst",New York Times,"The New York Times also said on 9 June 2015 in an article titled Al Qaeda Tries a New Tactic to Keep Power: Sharing It, After they routed the army in southern Yemen, fighters from Al Qaeda stormed into the city of Al Mukalla, seizing government buildings, releasing jihadists from prison and stealing millions of dollars from the central bank. Then they surprised everyone. Instead of raising their flags and imposing Islamic law, they passed control to a civilian council and gave it a budget to pay salaries, import fuel and hire teams to clean up garbage. The fighters receded into the background, maintaining only a single police station to arbitrate disputes… [The] branches [of Al Qaeda] in Yemen and Syria are now increasingly making common cause with local groups on the battlefield… Al Qaeda’s branches in Syria and Yemen have taken a different route [from the Islamic State], building ties with local groups and refraining from the strict application of Shariah, the legal code of Islam, when faced with local resistance, according to residents of areas where Al Qaeda holds sway. When Al Qaeda took over Al Mukalla in April, it seized government buildings and used trucks to cart off more than $120 million from the central bank … But it soon passed control to a civilian council, giving it a budget of more than $4 million to provide services, an arrangement that made sense to local officials seeking to serve their people during wartime. We are not Qaeda stooges,’ said Abdul-Hakeem bin Mahfood, the council’s secretary general, in a telephone interview. We formed the council to avoid the destruction of the city.’ While the council pays salaries and distributes fuel, Al Qaeda maintains a police station to settle disputes, residents said. It has so far made no effort to ban smoking or regulate how women dress. Nor has it called itself Al Qaeda, instead using the name the Sons of Hadhramaut to emphasize its ties to the surrounding province… Syria’s Qaeda affiliate, the Nusra Front, has made itself an essential component of the rebel forces seeking to oust Assad. It recently joined a rebel coalition called the Army of Conquest, putting itself in the same trenches as groups that receive support from the West. They are Muslims, no different from us,’ said Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the Nusra Front’s leader, in a recent interview with Al Jazeera. He also said his group had been ordered by Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda’s global leader, not to carry out foreign attacks that could disrupt the fight against Assad… Civilians living in Nusra Front areas, too, say the group has built local support, refraining from imposing Shariah when residents resisted. Meanwhile, its fighters have distributed food and fixed plumbing systems. In the village of Binnish, it recently fielded a team in a friendly soccer match against another rebel group. Nusra’s team wore fatigues in line with Islamic modesty, and it lost against players wearing shorts. Nusra are not extremists,’ said an activist who attended the game...

The title of the article was Why We Need al-Qaeda! Some of what he said was, Could the group long considered the most lethal terrorist organization in the world be the best option left in the Middle East for the US and its allies? … [M]embers of the US-led coalition against ISIS, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, are actively supporting al-Nusra with arms and money [indirect support, through opposition joint operations chambers and military, civilian, and local councils, and with the approval and awareness of the aid-providing countries]. … [M]uch of the Arab world is now essentially siding with AQAP in a Saudi-led war against Houthi rebels in that country. … The truth is that al-Qaeda has evolved in profound ways since the death of Osama bin Laden and the emergence of ISIS. … It also has increasingly set itself apart from ISIS in strategy and aims on battlefields in both Syria and Yemen… In this war the Arab states openly avoid bombing or attacking al-Nusra and AQAP, and in fact now provide both with financial support and weapons [indirectly, through the factions allied with them]. This is because both groups have now declared aims that are shared by the Arab states. … So al-Nusra and AQAP have become allies and not enemies of the Arab states, despite the fact that al-Qaeda itself once sought to overthrow these same regimes… [T]he Arabs are justified in concluding that al-Qaeda may be evolving. Both groups have now taken over cities and towns in their respective states … And both have set out policies of local control that differ markedly from those of ISIS. Consider al-Nusra, ISIS’s primary rival in Syria. Unlike ISIS, … al-Nusra is cooperating with other anti-Assad groups and recently joined the Army of Conquest alliance of rebel militias in northern Syria. Moreover, in contrast to ISIS’s largely international and non-Syrian fighting force, al-Nusra’s fighters are almost wholly Syrian, making them both more reliable and more committed to Syria’s future. Meanwhile, in interviews with Al Jazeera, al-Nusra leaders have vowed not to attack targets in the West, promoting an ideology that might be called nationalist jihadism’ rather than global jihad. In recent months, al-Nusra’s leaders have toned down the implementation of their own brutal version of Islamic law, while putting on hold their own plans of building a caliphate. Many of these same changes have been evident with AQAP in Yemen. … The group seized the capital Mukallah, robbed the bank, and then retreated, declining to run the government themselves or impose sharia law and installing a council of elders instead. They have urged the council to focus on governance and providing services to the people…",Refute,In the Words of the Enemy
Dabiq,10,Jun-15,"Media, Politician, or Analyst",Yaroslav Trofimov,"Yaroslav Trofimov wrote a similar piece for the Wall Street Journal on 11 June 2015 titled To U.S. Allies, Al Qaeda Affiliate in Syria Becomes the Lesser Evil – As Islamic State gains ground, calls to reach out to the Nusra Front intensify. In it he said, In the three-way war ravaging Syria, should the local al Qaeda branch be seen as the lesser evil to be wooed rather than bombed? This is increasingly the view of some of America’s regional allies and even some Western officials. … The three main forces left on the ground [in Syria] today are the Assad regime, Islamic State and an Islamist rebel alliance in which the Nusra Front—an al Qaeda affiliate designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and the United Nations—plays a major role. Outnumbered and outgunned, the more secular, Western-backed rebels have found themselves fighting shoulder to shoulder with Nusra in key battlefields. As the Assad regime wobbles and Islamic State, or ISIS, gains ground in both Syria and Iraq, reaching out to the more pragmatic Nusra is the only rational choice left for the international community, supporters of this approach argue… At first, it was mostly Turkey and Qatar that aided Syrian Islamist rebels cooperating with Nusra. Regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia was more reluctant, wary of abetting al Qaeda [by supporting factions allied with the Jawl?n? front]. … In recent months, however, Saudi Arabia’s new King Salman has moved to work much more closely with Doha and Ankara in supporting the Islamist-dominated rebel alliance that includes Nusra, diplomats and officials in the region say. These countries see the suffering inflicted on Syria by the Assad regime as the main reason for Islamic State’s emergence in the first place, and they prefer to see Nusra and its allies, rather than Islamic State, move into territory surrendered by Damascus… Unlike Islamic State, Nusra is largely composed of Syrians, and its religious views, though certainly radical, aren’t nearly as extreme. While it has refrained from attacking Israel despite controlling towns along the demarcation line in the Golan Heights, the group has taken on Islamic State and has been willing to work with non-Islamist rebels. Nusra has been a real magnet for young Syrian fighters who don’t have any particular jihadist or even radical sectarian agenda,’ said Frederic Hof, who served as President Obama’s envoy to the Syrian opposition … Nusra’s attempt to differentiate itself from Islamic State was clear in recent interviews that the group’s leader, Abu Muhammad al Jawlani, gave to Qatar’s Al Jazeera television network. Dressed in a plaid shirt and his face covered, Mr. Jawlani sat in a high-backed, thronelike chair once occupied by Idlib’s former governor. He fielded fawning questions during the two separate, nearly hourlong broadcasts, which were widely seen in the region as an effort by Qatar to make Nusra more attractive. While Mr. Jawlani repeated his allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri, he said Nusra wasn’t targeting the West and made conciliatory remarks about the Christian minority… [W]ith Islamic State on the offensive, Washington is likely to go pretty far’ in tolerating the budding collaboration between its regional allies and Nusra, said U.S. Navy Adm. James Stavridis, who retired two years ago as NATO’s supreme allied commander. It is unlikely we are going to operate side by side with cadres from Nusra, but if our allies are working with them, that is acceptable. If you look back to World War II, we had coalitions with people that we had extreme disagreements with, including Stalin’s Russia,’ said Mr. Stavridis … I don’t think that is a showstopper for the U.S. in terms of engaging with that coalition.’",Refute,In the Words of the Enemy

Dabiq,11,Aug-17,Classical Scholar,Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab,"Im?m Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahh?b ? said, These are matters in which the kit?b? and illiterate people of the J?hiliyyah opposed Allah’s Messenger ?. The Muslim cannot afford to be ignorant of these matters, for by the opposite of good, good becomes manifest. And through the opposite of matters, matters become distinct … The second of these matters [after major shirk] is that they are divided about their religion, as Allah ? said, {But the people divided their religion among them into sects – each faction, in what it has, rejoicing} [Al-Mu’min?n: 53]. They are also divided about their duny? and they consider this good. So he ? came with unity regarding the religion with Allah’s statement, {He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon N?h and that which We have revealed to you, and what We enjoined upon Ibr?h?m and M?s? and ?s? – to establish the religion and not be divided therein} [Ash-Sh?r?: 13]. Allah ? also said, {Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects – you have nothing to do with them} [Al-An’?m: 159]. He also prohibited us from being like them with Allah’s statement, {And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment} [?l Imr?n: 105]. He also prohibited us from dividing about the duny? with Allah’s statement, {And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided} [?l Imr?n: 103]. The third of these matters is that they considered disobeying the person in authority and refusing to yield to him a virtue. They considered hearing and obeying him humiliation and disgrace. Allah’s Messenger ? opposed them and ordered his companions to be patient with the injustices of the rulers2 . He ordered them to hear and obey them and give them sincere advice. He was severe about this, expressed it, and repeated it. These three matters he ? gathered together in the had?th reported by al-Bukh?r? and Muslim, Allah is pleased with three matters for you, that you worship Him and not associate anything with Him in worship, that you hold to the rope of Allah together and not divide, and that you sincerely advise those whom Allah gives authority over you.’ No calamity occurred in the people’s religion and duny? except by violation of these three principles or some of them [Mas?’il al-J?hiliyyah]",,The Evil of Division and Taqlid
Dabiq,11,Aug-17,Classical Scholar,Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab,"He ? also said, From the most amazing things and greatest signs showing the power of Allah ? are six principles that He ? made very clear more so than what the doubtful people think. Thereafter, many of the intelligent’ people of the world and wise’ men of mankind erred about these principles, except for a very few. … The second principle [after the obligation of tawh?d and prohibition of shirk] is that Allah ordered with unity regarding the religion and prohibited division within it. Allah clarified this with clear and conclusive evidence that the laymen can understand. He prohibited us from being like those who divided before us and thus were destroyed. He also mentioned that He ordered the Messengers with unity regarding the religion and prohibited them from division within it. What makes this clearer is what the Sunnah came with of amazing teachings in this regards. Then the matter changed until division over the fundamentals and branches of the religion became knowledge’ and fiqh of the religion’! And then no one called to the obligation to unite regarding the religion except for a zind?q’ or madman’! The third principle is that the fulfillment of unity is by hearing and obeying he who has been granted authority over us even if he might be an Ethiopian slave. Allah clarified this prevalently and sufficiently through various kinds of shar’? and qadar? evidences. It then became the fundamental not known to most of the claimants of knowledge.

Dabiq,11,Aug-17,Classical Scholar,Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab,"After Im?m Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahh?b ? mentioned the first three aspects of their religion (shirk, religious division, and political disunity), he said, The fourth matter is that their religion is based upon principles, the greatest of which is taql?d. It is the major principle for all the kuff?r, the first of them and last of them, as Allah ? said, {And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said, Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following} [Az-Zukhruf: 23].

There is not in your companion any madness. He is only a warner to you before a severe punishment} [Saba’: 46] and Allah’s statement, {Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies.

Dabiq,11,Aug-17,Classical Scholar,Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab,"He ? said, From their biggest principles is to be dazzled by the majority. They use this as evidence to claim something is correct. They also claim something is false by its strangeness and lack of followers. So he came to them with the opposite of such. Allah clarified it in more than one place in the Qur’?n.3 They also use the people of the past as proof, as described in Allah’s statement {[Fir’awn] said, Then what is the case of the former generations?} [T?h?: 51]. {We have not heard of this among our forefathers} [Al-Mu’min?n: 24]. They also use as proof a people who were given strength in intellect, feats, kingship, wealth, and honor. Allah rejected this by His statement, {And We had certainly established them in such as We have not established you, and We made for them hearing and vision and hearts. But their hearing and vision and hearts availed them not from anything when they were rejecting the signs of Allah; and they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule} [Al-Ahq?f: 26]. They also claim something is false due to no one following it except the weak. {Should we believe you while you are followed by the lowest [class of people]?} [Ash-Shu’ar?: 111], {Is it these whom Allah has favored among us?} [Al-An’?m: 53]. So Allah responded with His statement, {Is not Allah most knowing of those who are grateful?} [Al-An’?m: 53]. They follow the sinful scholars and worshippers. So he ? came to them with Allah’s statement, {O you who have believed, indeed many of the scholars and the monks devour the wealth of people unjustly and avert them from the way of Allah} [At-Tawbah: 34] and with Allah’s statement, {Do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way} [Al-M?’idah: 77]. They also claim the religion is false due to its small amount of followers and their lack of intellect, as in their statement {simple-minded} [H?d: 27]. They use as evidence incorrect qiy?s, as in their statement, {You are not but men like us} [Ibr?h?m: 10]. They also reject correct qiy?s.4 What links this matter to the former is that they do not understand the difference between the inclusive and the distinctive. They go to extremes in their love and imitation of the scholars and righteous, as described in Allah’s statement, {O People of the Book, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth} [AnNis?’: 171].

Dabiq,11,Aug-17,Classical Scholar,Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab,"Know also that the taql?d of the j?hil? people was not towards pious scholars or scholarly worshippers, but rather, as Im?m Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahh?b said, Their religious leaders were either corrupt scholars or ignorant worshippers, as described in Allah’s statement, {A party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then distort the Tawr?h after they had understood it while they were knowing} [Al-Baqarah: 75] to His statement, {And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Book except in wishful thinking, but they are only assuming} [Al-Baqarah: 78] [Mas?’il al-J?hiliyyah].",,The Evil of Division and Taqlid
Dabiq,11,Aug-17,Classical Scholar,Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab,"He ? also described this condition by saying, The fourth principle is clarifying what knowledge and fiqh is, who the scholars and fuqah?’ are, and who attempts to resemble them but is not truly from them. Allah ? has clarified this principle in S?rat al-Baqarah in His description of Ban? Isr?’?l [Al-Baqarah: 40-121]. What makes this clearer is what the Sunnah clarified on this matter with many clear and apparent words that the most simple layman can grasp easily. This principle then became the strangest of matters. Knowledge’ and fiqh’ became bid’ah and deviation; the best’ thing they could do is confuse the truth with falsehood for others. Now no one utters the knowledge that Allah ? obligated upon the creation and praised except a zind?q’ or madman’! And the person who denounces it, holds enmity towards it, authors warnings against and condemnations of it, became the faq?h’ and scholar’! The fifth principle is that Allah clarified who His awliy?’ are, and made them distinct from those who attempt to resemble them from amongst His hypocritical and corrupt enemies. One ?yah in S?rat ?l Imr?n is sufficient in clarifying this, {Say, If you should love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you} [?l Imr?n: 31], and one ?yah in S?rat al-M?’idah, {O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion – Allah will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him who are humble toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers; they strive for the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of a critic} [Al-M?’idah: 51], and ?y?t in S?rat Y?nus, {Unquestionably, there will be no fear for the allies of Allah, nor will they grieve. They are those who believed and were fearing Allah} [Y?nus: 62-63]. Then – according to the claimants of knowledge who claim to be guides for the creation and preservers of the Shar?’ah – the matter became that the awliy?’ must abandon following the Messengers, and whoever follows the Messenger is not from the awliy?. They must also abandon jih?d, and whoever performs jih?d is not from them. They must also abandon ?m?n and taqw?, and whoever commits to ?m?n and taqw? is not from them.

So the fornicators, the sodomites, the abandoners of jih?d, the people of bid’ah, and the drunkards, these people and the mingling with them is harmful for the religion of Islam.

Is the calamity of the religion from anyone but these who if their food and positions are safe, then they care not what happens to the religion? The best of them is he who tries to be sad and barely opens his mouth. If he were to be disputed over something that pains him of his honor or wealth, he would exert, strive, and use all three levels of denunciation to the best of his ability. These people, in addition to them falling from the eye of Allah and Allah hating them, have been afflicted in the Duny? with the greatest affliction possible while not realizing it, that is the death of the heart, because the more the heart is alive, the stronger the anger for Allah and His Messenger is and the more complete the rush to support the religion is [I’l?m al-Muwaqqi’?n].",,The Evil of Division and Taqlid

As for jih?d, commanding the good, forbidding the evil, being sincere towards Allah and His Messenger, sincerely advising His slaves, and supporting Allah, His Messenger, His religion, and His book, then these deeds do not come to their mind, never mind wanting to do them, never mind actually doing them. The least religious of people and the most hated by Allah are those who abandon these deeds even if they have zuhd towards all the Duny?. It is rare that you find one of them having his face change and turn red for Allah’s sake, get angry for His sanctuary, and exert himself in support of His religion.

Rumiyah,3,Nov-16,Tafsir,"Muhammad al-Amin Shanqiti, ""Adwa al-Bayan""","The author of Adwa al-Bayan said, Committing shirk in Allah’s rule is like committing shirk in His worship. Allah said concerning His rule, He does not have shirk in His rule with anyone’ (Al-Kahf 26). In the recitation of Ibn Amir, one of the seven reciters, it comes in the form of a forbiddance: Do not commit shirk with anyone in His rule.’ Likewise, Allah said concerning the act of committing shirk in His worship, Whoever longs to meet His Lord – let him do righteous deeds and not commit shirk with anyone in the worship of his Lord’ (Al-Kahf 110). Both commands are equal, as is clearly seen. He then said, What this noble verse entails – that rule belongs to Allah alone, without partner, according to both recitations – has been further explained in other verses. He then mentioned from among them Allah’s statement, The rule is only for Allah. He has commanded that you worship only Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know (Yusuf 40), and His statement, Is it the rule of Jahiliyyah they want? But who is better than Allah in rule for a people who have firm faith (Al-Maidah 50), and His statement, Is it other than Allah I should seek as a judge while it is He who has revealed to you the Book explained in detail? (Al-An’am 114). He then said, What is understood from these verses… is that the followers of the rulings of lawmakers who legislate what Allah has not permitted are committing shirk with Allah. This understanding was made clear in other verses, such as in Allah’s statement concerning those who follow Shaytan’s legislation in permitting maytah [the meat of unslaughtered animals] under the pretext that they were slaughtered by Allah: Do not eat of that upon which the name of Allah has not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience. Indeed the devils inspire their awliya [patrons] to dispute with you, and if you were to obey them, indeed, you would be mushrikin’ (Al-An’am 121). So he declared them to be mushrikin due to their obedience [to taghut legislation], and this shirk in obedience – following legislation that rivals what Allah has legislated – is what is meant by worshiping Shaytan in Allah’s statement, Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Shaytan – [for] indeed, he is a clear enemy to you – and that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path’ (Yasin 60-61). He then said, For this reason, Allah named as shuraka’ [partners] those who are obeyed in the sins they beautify. He ? said, Likewise, the shuraka’ of the mushrikin have beautified to them the killing of their children in order to bring about their destruction and to mislead them in their religion. And if Allah had willed, they would not have done so. So leave them and that which they devise’ (Al-An’am 137). The Prophet ? explained this to Adiy Ibn Hatim ? when Adiy asked about Allah’s statement, They took their rabbis and monks as lords besides Allah’ (At-Tawbah 31). The Prophet ? explained to him that the clergy permitted for them what Allah had prohibited, and prohibited for them what Allah had permitted, and the Jews and Christians followed them in that regard, and that was their taking of their clergy as lords. From the most explicit of evidences concerning this is that Allah ? explained in Surat an-Nisa that He is amazed at the claim of faith from those who want to seek judgment from what Allah has not legislated, and that is only because their claim of having faith despite their desire to seek judgment from taghut reaches a level of lying so great that it is amazing, and this is in His statement, Have you not seen those who claim to have believed in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They wish to seek judgment from taghut, while they were commanded to disbelieve in it; and Shaytan wishes to lead them far astray’ (An-Nisa 60). Through these divine texts we have quoted, it becomes absolutely clear that none doubts the kufr and shirk of those who follow the manmade laws which Shaytan has legislated upon the tongues of his allies in opposition to what Allah ? has legislated upon the tongue of His messengers ? except one whose vision Allah has wiped out and whom He has blinded from seeing the light of the revelation like He did to the followers of the taghut legislators (Adwa al-Bayan).",,The Religion of Islam

And as for you, O soldiers of the t?gh?t who serve to secure his throne, by Allah, you will not enjoy a pleasant life as long as you serve as guards for the one whose planes, together with the West, bomb our brothers, and as long as you serve as his minions, imprisoning our brothers and sisters, waging war against Ahlus-Sunnah and making peace with the R?fidah. So receive glad tidings of that which will ruin your lives. By Allah, you will not be safe, O soldier, neither in your home nor on the streets. We will lie in wait for you at every place of ambush. We have come to you with men who love death just as you love life, and race one another to fight you just as you compete with one another to attain higher positions, O you cowards. My second message is to the zealous lions. Allah ? said, as per the recitation of Khalaf from Hamzah, {Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah, so they are killed and they kill. [It is] a true promise [binding] upon Him in the Tawr?h and the Inj?l and the Qur’?n. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment} [At-Tawbah: 111]. Sell your lives to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. Strike with istishh?d? operations and explosive belts! These istishh?d? operations have proven their benefit and have produced their fruits. Their benefit has become widespread, and they have become a source of calamity and destruction for the crusaders and their corrupt supporters, and they are more harmful than rifles and machine guns. They have planted terror in their hearts, so much so that the enemies of Allah are now afraid of everything and wait for death to come to them from every direction. In addition to that, they result in the least amount of loss out of all the shar’? methods of fighting, while at the same time being the most effective. This is the advice that I wished to convey to my brothers in the Peninsula of Muhammad ?. {And Allah is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know} [Yusuf: 21].",,The Final Statement of Abu Sinan an-Najdi

In the article, they report that Obama secretly wrote to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and that his letter described a shared interest in fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. The letter was aimed both at buttressing the campaign against Islamic State and nudging Iran’s religious leader closer to a nuclear deal and stressed that any cooperation on Islamic State was largely contingent on Iran reaching a comprehensive agreement with global powers on the future of Tehran’s nuclear program. The letter also marked at least the fourth time Obama has written Iran’s most powerful political and religious leader since taking office in 2009 and pledging to engage with Tehran’s Islamist government and underscores that Obama views Iran as important … to his emerging military and diplomatic campaign to push Islamic State from the territories it has gained. Through the letter, Obama seeks to assuage Iran’s concerns about the future of its close ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and reassures Iran that the U.S.’s military operations inside Syria aren’t targeted at Assad or his security forces. They also report that the Obama administration launched secret talks with Iran in the Omani capital of Muscat in mid-2012 and that White House press secretary Josh Earnest … acknowledged U.S. officials in the past have discussed the Islamic State campaign with Iranian officials on the sidelines of international nuclear talks. He added the negotiations remain centered on Iran’s nuclear program. They also report that Obama sent two letters to Iran’s 75-year-old supreme leader during the first half of 2009, calling for improvements in U.S.-Iran ties … U.S.-Iran relations have thawed considerably since the election of President Hasan Rouhani in June 2013. He and Obama shared a 15-minute phone call in September 2013, and Messrs. Kerry and Zarif have regularly held direct talks on the nuclear diplomacy and regional issues and that the State Department has confirmed that senior U.S. officials have discussed Iraq with Zarif on the sidelines of nuclear negotiations in Vienna. U.S. diplomats have also passed on messages to Tehran via Abadi’s government in Baghdad and through the offices of Iraq’s Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, among the most powerful religious leaders in the Shiite world. Among the messages conveyed to Tehran, according to U.S. officials, is that U.S. military operations in Iraq and Syria aren’t aimed at weakening Tehran or its allies.

A meeting occurred in which the Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed to become an authority in administering the affairs of the provincial capital and in coordination with and under the supervision of the governor of Hadramawt Province, Dr. ?dil Muhammad B?ham?d. With success granted by Allah, the council reached an agreement with the Sons of Hadramawt consisting of the following: First, they have to hand over all the public utilities and the administration of them to the Hadhrami Domestic Council. It is also the right of the Domestic Council to appoint whom it wishes as its head. Second, the Domestic Council is responsible for administrating the matter of public security and its stations. Third, what is needed to facilitate the job of the Council and administer services will be provided by the Sons of Hadramawt to the Domestic Council, as agreed by both sides … The council calls … all the directors of offices and all the civil and security bodies to pursue their work under the supervision of the council … The council also commends the efforts of Operation Decisive Storm under the leadership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council to deter the aggression of the Houthis and their allies.",,The Allies of al-Qaidah in Yemen

Dabiq,12,Nov-15,Jihadist,Hadhrami Domestic Council,"In an announcement released on 21 April 2015, the council said, Since … the collapse of all the institutions of the state, army, and security, and the control of those who call themselves The Sons of Hadramawt’ over the affairs of the provincial capital, and after constant communication with the governor of the province of Hadramawt … the scholars, tribal elders, and notables placed their exhaustive efforts into convincing The Sons of Hadramawt’ of the danger of their remaining in control of the political offices of the government and its other buildings, something that could lead to regional and international military interference whose outcome would be disastrous for the people and land. These efforts resulted in an agreement decreeing the handover of all government facilities and public security centers to a domestic Hadhrami council formed by scholars and tribal nobles … They go on to say, The brother, the governor of the Hadramawt province, blessed this agreement; rather he initially agreed to be the head of the council. He later proposed being a coordinator and supervisor over the council. After a few days, the armed forces defending the airport, ad-Dabbah, Brigade 27, and Air force Brigade 190 all withdrew. It is not true that the Domestic Hadhrami Council received these camps and handed them over to The Sons of Hadramawt.’ Rather, the Sons of Hadramawt’ overran them first. Because of these events, an emergency meeting was held by the Domestic Council on 29/6/1436AH coinciding with 18 April 2015. The following resolutions were made there: First resolution: The negotiations between the Domestic Council and The Sons of Hadramawt’ will continue. The seizing of control over the public facilities and the responsibility to administer the affairs of the provincial capital will not be complete until The Sons of Hadramawt’ abide by the following conditions. They must: A) Gradually hand over all the government facilities to the Domestic Council. B) Hand over the seaport, the airport, and the military camps to the Domestic Council. C) Hand over sufficient amounts and sufficient types of vehicles, weapons, and munitions (in accordance with the demands of the council’s security committee) to enable the achievement of the council’s duties in maintaining public security and military posts. D) Return at least two billion riyals from the money that was taken from the Central Bank to the Domestic Council for the council to manage the affairs of the province. E) Not execute arrests or house raids after the Domestic Council takes authority except if it is proven that an individual works against the security of the province. The second resolution: Communication with the President and Vice President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, and the governor of the province will continue until a declaration is released in which they announce their support of the Domestic Council so as to achieve security, stability, and normalization of affairs in Hadramawt… The results of the negotiations with The Sons of Hadramawt’ were as follows: The Sons of Hadramawt’ agreed to hand over the public facilities and the administration of these facilities whenever the Domestic Council requests so. The Sons of Hadramawt’ agreed to hand over the seaport, the airport, and the military camps, except for Brigade 27, to the Domestic Council … The Sons of Hadramawt’ agreed to provide the Domestic Council with a sufficient amount of vehicles, weapons, emergency vehicles, and police vehicles, so as to facilitate the job of the council’s security committee … The Sons of Hadramawt’ agreed to stop carrying out any arrests or house raids after the Domestic Council takes authority of the city unless the danger of an individual against the security of Hadramawt is certain.",,The Allies of al-Qaidah in Yemen
Dabiq,12,Nov-15,Jihadist,Isa Ibn Sa'd al Ushan,"I am pleased to present my advice to the muj?hid?n in particular, and the Muslims in general through Sawtul-Jih?d magazine. The first piece of advice – following my advice to fear Allah and be mindful of Him – is to listen to and obey those whom Allah has given authority over the affairs of the muj?hid?n. The Ummah today has been afflicted by the treacherous, apostate rulers and leaders who have even violated the rights of Allah in addition to the rights of His creation. And it is known that the authority of these rulers is invalid, and that it is obligatory to oppose them and wage war against them. But what is meant by listening and obeying here is in reference to those whom Allah has given authority over the affairs of jih?d [and now, the Khil?fah]. This is a very important and very serious matter, which the Wise legislator has urged. And His Messenger g has made disobedience of one’s leader similar to disobedience of the Prophet g. Listening and obeying is from unity, cooperation, and strength, in contrast with quarrelling, disunity, and disagreement. Quarrelling and disagreement in jih?d is considered a means of failure and defeat. {And do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient. Indeed, Allah is with the patient} [Al-Anf?l: 46]. He who studies history and S?rah sees that disobeying the leader – in any form – has a severe, adverse consequence, and the best example of that is what happened to the Sah?- bah in the Battle of Uhud when they disobeyed the Prophet g and as a result, the Muslim army suffered a setback and calamity, including many of the best Sah?bah being killed, and the Prophet g and a number of other Sah?bah being wounded. This was all the result of disobeying the leader, the Prophet g. And how many times has a leader been disobeyed in some of the lands and arenas of jih?d, and the price paid as a result was calamity and tribulation that included blood being spilled and lives being lost, for disobeying the leader is not merely a sin that affects the sinner alone. Rather, it affects the entire group, and most of the time the entire army. How many times has a muj?hid brother been ordered by his leader not to go to a certain area, but he disobeys the leader and as a result he lands in captivity! And how many times has a brother disobeyed the leader with respect to security measures and precautions, and as a result he and a group of his brothers land in captivity! There are many instances where a group of brothers were taken captive or arrested because one of them disobeyed the security precautions they were instructed with by the am?r. One of the many small examples mentioned in this regard is an incident that was related to me by one of the brothers about a man who wanted to join the training camps in Afghanistan. The person responsible for his departure gave him instructions not to call his family until he reached Pakistan. But the brother disobeyed this order and called his family from the airport in his country just before boarding the plane. Immediately, his family hastened to speak to the airport officials and managed to catch him before the plane took off. So he paid the price of disobedience by being deprived of preparing for and undertaking jih?d for Allah’s cause! There are many such incidents, but here I would like to advise the brothers who have refused to live a life of humiliation and have overcome their desires and lusts, to fasten on themselves the bridle of listening to and obeying the leaders in everything big and small, for obedience is in everything except in sin. And if the leader’s order is an issue of ijtih?d where there are two or more legitimate opinions and the leader has adopted one of the opinions – regardless of whether it is the more correct or the less correct opinion – it is obligatory to yield to the opinion he has chosen and submit to his order, because the issue is an issue of ijtih?d and there is no denunciation in that. And beware of looking for loopholes to avoid obeying the order to the letter, as they are the causes of grief and calamity. Whenever someone wants to disobey the leader, if he were to look for an excuse for himself he would find it. So those who disobeyed the Prophet g in the Battle of Uhud, their excuse was that the battle was over and there was no longer any point in remaining on the archers’ mountain, and so on and so forth… So do not look for excuses when you are thinking of disobeying the order, but rather compel yourself to follow the order and not overstep it. It is sad to see that the people of falsehood and the armies of the taw?gh?t listen and obey and that they are relatively disciplined. You would see one of them committing a sin - even committing kufr - and if he were asked about it he would foolishly say, I’m a slave who’s been given orders! Whereas you find that listening to and obeying the leader [who does not order with sin] is a matter that is somewhat lost and weak when it comes to the muj?hid?n. Wall?hul-Musta’?n… It is obligatory on you, my noble brother, to harshly denounce anyone who disobeys the leader, and to assist your leader and your brothers in preventing any disobedience and mistake that the Ummah and the muj?hid?n would pay the price for. And know, O blessed one, that listening and obeying is from being humble towards the believers, and that to violate this is to be harsh on the believers! I conclude my advice with the following poetry: Listen to my truthful advice, for indeed I want good and benefit for you, O my brother. Your obedience to your leader is an essential necessity, and whoever disobeys his order commits a sin. To listen to and obey the leader is to listen to the command of Muhammad, the conveyer of glad tidings. As for opposing the command and disobeying, then it is a sin against the Judge (Allah). And it is the foundation of weakness and defeat, and leads to corrupt opinions and loss of resolve. And what occurred to the Sah?bah in the Battle of Uhud is forever a lesson for every believer. So adhere to and be diligent in obedience and don’t get tired. Listen both in times of dislike and delight, Unless the leader’s order is against the Shar?’ah, for there is no obedience to the leader in such. I ask Allah to help both me and you, my brother, in listening and obeying, and to not to make us a cause for any harm to befall our brothers through our sins, and to forgive us if we forget or make mistakes",,Listen to the Mujahidin: Listen and Obey
Dabiq,12,Nov-15,Jihadist,Syrian Revolutionary Factions,"On 15 September 2015, a declaration was released by the Syrian revolutionary factions in which they said: The representatives of the Syrian revolutionary fighting factions have met together and discussed the presidential statement by the UN Security Council issued on August 17, 2015, as well as the plan proposed by the UN envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura. The meeting factions have acknowledged that the statement by the UN Security Council could provide an enabling environment for starting an objective political negotiation and trust-building among all parties. The meeting factions have reached a consensus on the following: 1. We welcome the call to start a political process that leads to a political transition according to the Geneva Communiqué that stipulates establishing a transitional governing body that starts functioning as soon as an agreement on a solution is reached, and thus, performing all executive authorities, including those of the President of the Republic. 2. We emphasize the precondition of the departure of Bashar al-Assad and all the pillars of his regime, and that none of them would have a place or a role in the new Syria or the transitional phase. We consider this as a basic precondition for carrying out any political process. 3. Implementing the resolution 2139 that calls for all parties to stop waging any attacks against civilians; and to refrain from the indiscriminate use of weapons on the populated areas, in the manner that includes the indiscriminate bombardment and dropping explosive barrels on civilians, as well as the immediate stoppage of coercive indiscriminate detention, torture and kidnapping, as well as the immediate release of all detainees. 4. We emphasize the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution 2165 for the year 2014 that allows all parties in the Syrian conflict to convey the humanitarian aid immediately and without any obstacles, so as to deliver such aid directly to the people. 5. We reject overlooking and being silent about the terrorist groups that the Assad regime summoned to Syria and embraced, while they actually exercise genocide and forced displacements of population as well as introducing demographic change in Syria; such groups include the sectarian militias, the Iranian Republican Guards and the Lebanese Hezbollah. We call for listing these groups on the Terrorism Lists. 6. Respecting the will of the Syrian people; as the Syrians are the sole beholders of the power for founding the Constitution of the future Syria and approving each of its articles. This means that there should be no prior principles imposed on the people as a way for confiscating their free will. 7. We call for excluding Iran from any consultations concerning the Syrian cause, as Iran is truly red-handed with the blood of the Syrians, being a supporter of the terrorist militias, as well as acting to ignite sectarian strife among the Syrian people, in addition to the fact that Iran does not recognize the Geneva Communiqué as a reference (though this Communiqué has been fully supported by the UN Security Council resolution 2118). 8. We emphasize the continuity of the service-providing State institutions as a necessary and vital issue. And yet, we reject the continuity of the works of the army and security institutions. We call for dissolving the security apparatus and restructuring the army and the judiciary. 9. The UN Security Council stated that it is calling for holding political negotiations and achieving political transition on the basis of Geneva Communiqué. The establishment of a transitional governing body has been very clear and explicit in the Communiqué. And thus, we call the UN Envoy to engage directly into the implementation of the Geneva Communiqué in a manner that is surrounded with regional and international guarantees; all without reverting to any preempted measures or committees formed that would consume time and lead to the rendering of the Geneva Communiqué void of content. 10. We emphasize the necessity of having real guarantees that obligate to all parties to implement whatever is agreed upon; as the Syrian regime has been accustomed to non-commitment to all resolutions throughout the past five years. 11. The explicit grave Russian intervention on Syrian territory is undermining the efforts exerted to reach a political solution. 12. We call upon the UN and the UN Security Council to bear their responsibilities towards the Syrian tragedy, and to act seriously towards the implementation of the relevant resolutions in a manner that serves the interests of the Syrian people.",,The Allies of al-Qaidah in Sham: The End
Dabiq,12,Nov-15,Jihadist,The Five Principles of the Syrian Revolution,"Then on 18 September 2015, a document was released titled The Five Principles of the Syrian Revolution and decorated with the j?hil? flag of Sykes-Picot. In it, they said: This is a declaration to the great Syrian people and the freemen of the world everywhere. As-Sal?mu alaykum wa rahmatull?h wa barakatuh. The Syrian revolution was launched against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, and to achieve justice, transparency, and the recovery of ravished honor and freedom. The revolution resisted what the regime confronted it with including various kinds of repression and offence. The Syrian people, the launchers of this revolution, are not able to compromise their human and national rights guaranteed to them by Islam and all the heavenly religions and the international laws and systems. They will carry on upon their path, holding on to all of its goals, through all legit means. Amongst these means is a political solution in accordance with the following fixed principles: 1) Eliminating Bashar al-Asad and all the pillars of his regime and to bring them before a just trial. 2) Dismantling the tyrannical intelligence and military apparatuses and building security and military apparatuses based upon honest national roots while preserving the other state institutions. 3) The expulsion of all the foreign and sectarian terrorist forces from Syria, represented by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Hezbollah, Abul-Fadl al-Abb?s militia, and the Islamic State organization.5 4) Preserving the unity of Syria as a country and people and preserving its independence, sovereignty, and its people’s identity. 5) Rejection of any distribution of power based on political agendas and sectarianism. Any method followed in negotiations for a political solution while not taking into account the dreams of the Syrian people is an attempt to bypass their goals. Accordingly, it is considered a waste of time. Similarly, any attempt to solve the important issues such as reconstruction, combatting terrorism, achieving domestic security and peace, and establishing a constitutional system, while not proceeding from the fixed principles of our great people will not be accepted by the Syrians, because doing so only dwarfs their cause and examines the symptoms while ignoring the root of the problem. Although, we consider that every effort provided to save Syria to be an appreciated effort, we believe that delaying the decision on the major issue – which is the departure of al-Asad and his militias, the establishment of a united, independent, national, Syrian state – without guaranteeing any serious promises in this regards, will only increase the complexity of the problem and the depths of the wounds. The Security Council – which is responsible legally, politically, and morally to preserve world peace – has failed to defend the Syrian people, contribute in achieving their noble goals, and prevent the occurrence of massacres carried out against them. This is while we see attempts to rehabilitate the regime, even serious endeavors to make it a part of the present and future of Syria. We also see the Security Council ignoring the terrifying massacres that occurred and continue to occur before and after the presidential statement. The national forces who signed this document reaffirm their adherence to the fixed principles of the Syrian people in their glorious revolution and consider that any transgression against these principles to be negligence towards the rights of the Syrians, disdain of their blood and sacrifice, and an effort that will never succeed, because it assumes and enforces a foundation that is rejected legally, politically, and morally.",,The Allies of al-Qaidah in Sham: The End
Dabiq,12,Nov-15,Jihadist,,"This was followed by a third document released on 3 October 2015. In it, they say: Political offices of the undersigned rebel factions and the Syrian Coalition’s political committee held a meeting and thoroughly studied the proposals put forward by the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura, namely the Working groups’ initiative. After in-depth reviewing of the regional and international reality engulfing the Syrian arena as well as recent sensitive developments with profound field and political influence, and out of our concern for the possibility of launching a new failed political process costing Syrians even more thousands of lives, and more destruction to the remnants of the countrys infrastructure, we affirm the following points: First: Participants in the meeting emphasize their commitment to reaching a political solution to achieve the goals of the revolution, preserve the identity of the Syrian people and end their suffering. This political process however must ensure that the current regime is not reproduced or that its head and pillars, whose hands are stained with the blood of Syrians, are not given any role in the transitional political process or in Syria’s future. Second: While forces of the revolution and the opposition have always dealt fully positive with the UN envoy despite the absence of any practical results on the ground, they emphasize they will continue to positively deal with the United Nations in order to achieve the interests of the Syrian people. Third: The Syrian people have completely lost confidence in the ability of the international community to support their cause after five years of regime crimes committed against them with Iranian military support, Russian political coverage and a legitimacy that the international community still insists on providing to the murderous regime. The current popular outrage must be taken into account in any political process which must be preceded by real steps to win the confidence of the Syrian people. The most important of these steps is to explicitly declare that the head of the regime and its pillars cannot be given any role to play in the political process. Fourth: Bashar al-Assad has no place in any political process depending on the following legal and practical reasons: Bashar al-Assad inherited power in an entirely illegal way. Bashar al-Assad became a war criminal the moment he began killing Syrians who peacefully demanded their rights. He used illegal chemical weapons against innocent civilians. These crimes have been documented by neutral international organizations to prevent any doubt in the matter. Bashar al-Assad and his regime have shown utmost reluctance to engage in any political process, have not abided by any declared truces, and have shown non-cooperation with the international community purely with humanitarian issues. All of this has left him with no credibility or confidence. While Bashar al-Assad and his regime have failed in their alleged war against ISIS or to achieve any intellectual or field victory against this extremist organization, there is compelling evidence on full coordination between the two sides and the role Assad’s regime plays in the emergence of ISIS.6 Bashar al-Assad has opened the doors of Syria to foreign militias who commit the worst sectarian massacres at the same time as fuelling sectarian rhetoric, which deprives him of any eligibility to participate in any political process that aims to unite the country. Finally, Bashar al-Assad has handed over Syria to Iranian and Russian invaders, thus committing an unforgivable act of betrayal to the country’s history, its future and dignity. Fifth: We consider that dissolving the security agencies and the restructuring of the military institution directly responsible for killing Syrians an essential item for any political solution. This beleaguered and crumbling military institution has turned into sectarian militias led by Iran. It cannot therefore form the nucleus of a national army, nor can it be trusted by the Syrian people to restore security and stability to the country. Sixth: The formation of a transitional governing body is a process of full transfer of power in which Bashar al-Assad and pillars of his regime have no place. We emphasize the need to preserve state institutions and prevent their disintegration as they belong to the Syrian people, and to prevent the country from sliding into more chaos. Seventh: We consider that proposing the Working groups’ initiative ignores the majority of the relevant United Nations resolutions on Syria, particularly resolutions 2118, 2165 and 2139. This initiative is in fact a complicated political process that requires confidence-building between the Syrian people on the one hand and the party that will sponsor the political process, namely the United Nations. Confidence-building can only be achieved through the implementation of the above-mentioned UN resolutions that the Syrian regime has so far disabled them. Eighth: We consider that the Working groups’ initiative in its current form and its unclear mechanisms provides the perfect environment to reproduce the regime. These Working groups’ must instead be based on clear principles regarding standards for selecting the participants in these groups and the final vision for the solution. Ninth: We condemn Russia’s direct military escalation in Syria and consider the Syrian regime fully responsible as it has turned Syria into a hotbed for foreign intervention. The silence of the international community also bears responsibility for this escalation and represents a point of no return in the relationship between the Syrian people and Russia. This escalation clearly shows that Russia is not serious or sincere in its commitment to the political process, and that it has never been a honest mediator but a party to the conflict and a key ally of the criminal regime. Tenth: While forces of the revolution and its institutions reaffirm commitment to our people, we vow to exert the utmost efforts to close ranks and correct previous mistakes. We also vow that the revolution will remain faithful to its principles and the blood of its fallen heroes, and that we will strike a balance between achieving our objectives and safeguarding our fundamental principles. We also pledge to alleviate the suffering of our people, expedite victory and to dedicate our political and military capabilities for this purpose. Accordingly, the Working groups’ initiative in its current form is unacceptable neither practically nor legally unless the above-mentioned points are taken into consideration and the ambiguities shaping the mechanisms of this initiative are resolved.",,The Allies of al-Qaidah in Sham: The End

When he saw that, he went to the rear of one hundred of his soldiers, moving slowly back until he was alone and found himself in one of the valleys of the Romans. He suddenly saw around thirty non-Arab horses that were fastened, and inside the church next to them were the knights to whom those horses belonged, the very knights who had been harassing his rearguard. So he dismounted from his horse and fastened it. He then entered the church and locked the door on both himself and the Romans, so the Romans were amazed at him locking the door, and by the time they had taken up their spears he had already struck down three of them. His companions found him missing, so they searched for him and came to the church. They recognized his horse, and heard the clamor inside the church, so they went to it but found that its door was locked. So they removed part of the roof and descended upon them. Busr was holding part of his intestines in his hand and his sword was in his right hand. Once his companions managed to get inside the church, he fell unconscious. They then advanced on the Romans, killing some of them and taking some of them prisoner. The prisoners then turned to them and said, We ask you by Allah, who is this man?’ They said, Busr Ibn Artah.’ So the Romans said, By Allah, no woman has ever given birth to his likes!’ His companions then tended to his intestines and placed them back inside him, and nothing of his intestines had been torn.

We talked to the IRA, not because they had guns but because they had a third of the Catholic vote. If you’re dealing with a group with no political support, such as Baader-Meinhof, you’re not going to negotiate because there isn’t a political question at the heart of the matter. And it seems to me likely there is a political question at the heart here in Syria and Iraq. If the conflicts I’ve looked at over the last 30 years are anything to go by, and if ISIS have political support, then we will end up speaking to them.

They support them in their wars that are not jih?d for Allah’s sake. 20) They call the muj?hid?n takf?riyy?n’ because the muj?hid?n pronounce takf?r upon the crusaders, the Jews, the zan?diqah, and the apostates. 21) They welcome cooperation with the k?fir and apostate states. 22) They follow and call for strict regionalism, as if they hold Sykes-Picot to be holy. 23) They call for a state of justice, law, and freedom, because they are embarrassed of Islam.2 24) They strive to guarantee safety for all the sects of kufr, apostasy, and heresy, so that these sects and the head of kufr [America] approves of these factions. 25) They announce their respect of human rights pacts. 26) They are embarrassed of the word jih?d,’ replacing it with revolution,’ revolutionary,’ and revolutionary action.’ 27) They promise not to own or attempt to obtain weapons of mass destruction, so as to calm Israel. 28) They announce that their operations are restricted to the Syrian lands, to calm the Jews. 29) They ask America to use them while not fearing that Allah will replace them … These are some of their traits. And the matter is more disastrous and the calamity is even more widespread… They attempt to seduce the muj?hid?n into accepting stipulations formulated in Ibl?s’s lodge. Ibl?s then applied the appropriate makeup and gave the stipulations to the samm?’?n so that they could promote them. From amongst the demands they made in accordance with the desires of Shayt?n and his proxies were: … that operations are executed by Syrians alone and that the muh?jir?n are banished. They also refused to denounce the pacts they formerly released, doing so in service of Shayt?n and his proxies. Let us discuss these demands from a number of angles. Who is the real demander of these stipulations? Is the demand from the samm?’?n or from the intelligence apparatuses of the apostate regimes behind these samm?’?n, the apparatuses these samm?’?n deal with? From the pacts that these samm?’?n announced before – a pact they recently declared their continued commitment to and refusal to renounce – was a pact published due to instructions from Turkey and Qatar, resulting from Western requests. The samm?’?n themselves admitted this in the presence of numerous leaders of the muj?hid?n, my poor self being amongst them. It becomes clear that the declarations and demands of the samm?’?n are nothing but an execution of the demands of the apostate states, who have behind them the centers of kufr and international masonry. So the demands of the samm?’?n are nothing but a demand from the apostates and the execution of the demand is done in obedience to the apostates, in line with their ranks. Can this be accepted by someone whose heart was touched by ?m?n or who tasted obedience to Allah? And are these demands in accordance with the Shar?’ah or in opposition to it? 1) There is no doubt they oppose it rom a number of angles … Unity of ranks is not viewed by them except through the eyesight of a chicken. They look to Syria as being the whole world … They then unify with the people of the American Military Operation Cooperation’ room, the followers of America, the soldiers of Ibl?s, and everyone upon whom the devils descend. 2) Accepting the stipulations of the samm?’?n also means approving or even partaking in their relationships and their receiving of instructions from the apostate states, and this is a man?t3 . 3) Accepting the stipulations of the samm?’?n also means approving of their seeking help from the kuff?r, and this is not permissible according to the Shar?’ah. 4) Accepting the stipulations of the samm?’?n also means approving of their restricting of jih?d to the Syrian lands, a becalming message to the Jews. This is not permissible according to the Shar?’ah, and is a form of foul regionalism. 5) Accepting the stipulations of the samm?’?n also means approving of their safeguarding of apostate and heretical sects, and this is a man?t. 6) The rest of the disasters found in their pacts including the struggle to establish a state of justice, freedom, and law, and other deviances, are not hidden from anyone with a mind even if he is a layman in Shar?’ah. He then describes them as an ally whose decision is in the hands of apostate regimes and who are allied to the apostate regimes and groups. They blatantly call to what is demanded from them by the kuff?r and apostates. This party with these traits leads the Jabhah [Jawl?n? front] towards the camp of treachery. If the Jabhah refuses to partake in the treachery of the samm?’?n, it will not be able to go back to square one, thereby bringing about its own end… He continues saying, Maybe some of the tricksters and circus performers of the Jabhah think that their abilities are very great and that they are able to trick the samm?’?n and tolerate them. But I say that this idea is very similar to that of the Ikhw?n who want to trick America, for the samm?’?n are not the player in front of the Jabhah, rather the samm?’?n are a bride on the stage of brides who are moved by strings in the hand of America, the head of the axis of evil, representing the Zionist-crusader coalition and those who follow its caravan from the apostate regimes, the Mossad, and all the forces of kufr who have declared war against Islam. I know that the opinion of the tricksters is not like this and that they continue to assume the best in the samm?’?n. I’m very sorry to say that these people are very, very few. Alhamdulill?h. They are in a distant delusion, straying in the passes of falsehood and crypts of deviance. The samm?’?n announced and continue to announce that they will never abandon the support coming to them from the apostate states. So when the Jabhah unites with them in a single body, what applies to them applies to it, including the seeking of help from the kuff?r and the submission to their conditions. This contradicts the teachings of the religion… To be brief, the samm?’?n are like a girl who lost her virginity by having har?m relationships with the apostate regimes behind her. She was irritated by every woman who preserved her honor, chastity, principles, and religion, and instead of repenting to Allah, she wants to entangle every chaste women so that they are like her in vileness. Allah (ta’?l?) said, {They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they perform hijrah for the cause of Allah} [An-Nis?’: 89]… Some of those with heartburn ask where the jih?d scene is headed and they expect a military conflict with the samm?’?n … I say, yes, the condition is dangerous. The condition in the arena is dangerous … As for the issue of a conflict with the samm?’?n, then I ask Allah that it doesn’t reach that, and that He prepares for the samm?’?n one who will return them to the truth. Nevertheless, the matter is severe… What is the difference between the group of samm?’?n and between Hazm and Jam?l Ma’r?f? Keep in mind that they gave refuge to the groups of Hazm and Ma’r?f after our conflicts with them. What is the difference between the group of samm?’?n and between Zink? and Zahr?n All?sh? Keep in mind that the samm?’?n are linked to All?sh through a coalition and strive to form a coalition with Zink? and its likes! All of them collect money from the outside. All of them follow agendas from the outside. And when the samm?’?n ally with people like these, it indicates that there is no difference between them. And when the samm?’?n denounce the actions of the Jabhah against Jam?l Ma’r?f and Hazm, this means they are in the other camp. And when they take arms from Ma’r?f’s group, claim that there is a se cret bay’ah from Ma’r?f’s group to them, and protect them from the Jabhah, this means they are in the other camp. Hazm, Jam?l Ma’r?f, the samm?’?n, Zink?, and their likes are connected to foreign agendas. They all receive aid from the governments of apostasy and kufr. The samm?’?n gave refuge to Ma’r?f and Hazm and protected them from us. All of them execute what is dictated to them. But the master of all of them has not asked from the samm?’?n what he asked from Hazm and Ma’r?f. Their like is that of the scholars of the t?gh?t … What the t?gh?t of Syria and t?gh?t of Egypt demanded from their muftis, the Saudi t?gh?t did not demand initially. So the Saudi scholars appeared more acceptable. But when the Saudi t?gh?t demanded from its scholars the same as the other taw?gh?t, they executed what was required of them … Rather, they did so in a more harmful and dangerous way. This is the exact difference between the samm?’?n and between Hazm and Ma’r?f. All the movements that collect money – throughout history and to this day and age – have submitted to their masters and executed their orders when demanded. They will remain slaves to those who pay them.4 He then ends his article with poetry in which he refers to the factions as the ambassadors of the Jews and crusader party who seduce the people of chastity and purity. These ambassadors drive the missions of kufr to us while displaying love for the lands of Sh?m … They are just the messengers of the enemies and apparatuses of the forces of apostasy.",,In the Words of the Enemy

After these frightening events, another event took place, which was the assassination of the Prime Minister Mahm?d Fahm? an-Naqr?sh? Pasha. The country was struck with sorrow due to his passing. It lost by his passing a star of its renaissance, a leader of its progress, a good role model of honesty, patriotism, and chastity. He was one of its best sons. We are no less saddened than others over his passing nor do we admire his jih?d and character less than others do. This is because the nature of the Islamic da’wah opposes violence; rather it censures it, abhors murder regardless of its type, and resents its perpetrators. For this reason, we declare our innocence before Allah of the murders and their perpetrators. Because our country is now passing through a stage that is one of the most significant of its life thus necessitating the providing of complete calm, security, and stability, his majesty the great king – may Allah protect him – was generous and directed the existent government, consisting of the top men of Egypt, to a righteous focus. That was to work to unite the word of the nation and close its ranks and direct its efforts and capacities altogether, not divided, to serve the good of the nation and its internal and foreign reforms. The government immediately began to execute the noble directives with sincerity, character, and honesty. All this makes it obligatory upon us to exert all our strength and spend our time in helping the government in executing and fulfilling its great responsibilities. It will not be able to do so correctly until it is certain that security and stability have been achieved for the regime. This is the obligation upon every citizen in normal times. How much more so is it in these delicate and crucial circumstances in which no one gains from the chaos of emotions, clash of ideas, and division of efforts except the enemies of the nation and its renaissance.

This is because the meaning of this statement is that the transmitters of the Qur’?n and the Sunnah were kuff?r or fuss?q.

They should not pay attention to any irresponsible statements from some of the domestic agents of the enemy, those who give this incident the image of being sectarian and domestic spite.

May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?} [Al-Mun?fiq?n: 4]. The message of history is confirmed by the testimony of current events, clearly informing the world that Shiism is a religion that does not agree with Islam except like how the Jews gather with the Christians under the label of People of the Book.’ Shiism contains everything from blatant shirk, to grave worship, to circumambulating tombs, to takf?r of the Sah?- bah, to cursing the Mothers of the Believers and the best of this Ummah, to claiming distortion of the Qur’?n – a logical result of their defamation of its carriers – in addition to the claim of the infallibility of the im?ms and that belief in them and recognition of their reception of revelation are a basis of faith as well as other forms of kufr and manifestations of zandaqah that their authoritative books and primary references overflow with. And they do not cease to print, distribute, and publish these books and references. The dreamers who think that the Shiite can forget his historical heritage and ancient black spite towards the Naw?sib – as the R?fidah label Ahlus-Sunnah – is mistaken. He is like someone who demands the Christian’ abandon the idea of the Messiah being crucified [and still call himself a Christian’]. Does an intelligent man do so? He then said, The R?fidah are a party of treachery and treason throughout history and the ages. It is a sect whose war is directed against Ahlus-Sunnah. After this discussion, he stated, The R?fidah: They are the key to change. I mean they should be targeted and struck in their religious, political, and military core. This will provoke them to manifest their rancor against Ahlus-Sunnah and bare the teeth of the B?tin? spite festering in their chests. If we succeed, it is possible to awaken the neglectful Sunnis, as they will feel the imminent danger and approaching death upon the hands of these Saba’iyyah [followers of Ibn Saba’]. Ahlus-Sunnah, despite their weakness and division, are sharper blades and more resolved and truthful on the battlefield than these B?tiniyyah, for the R?fidah are a people of treachery and cowardice. They only assail the weak. They only assault the helpless. Ahlus-Sunnah in general understand the danger of these people and are cautious and fearful of the results of such consolidation being granted to the R?fidah. If it were not for the cowardly dissuading heads of Sufism and the Ikhw?n, the people would have been much better off. This matter, in addition to what is anticipated from it of awakening those who are in slumber, will also trim the nails of these R?fidah and pull out their canines before the inevitable war. It is also anticipated to incite the anger of the people against the Americans, who brought this destruction and who were the cause of this evil. It will also deter the people from enjoying leisure and achieving some of the delights they were prohibited before, which would make them succumb to comfort, cling to the earth, prefer safety, and turn them back from the clashing of swords and neighing of steeds. The Method of Operation: Our condition dictates that we deal with the matter with courage and clarity and endeavor for a solution … The solution as we believe, and Allah knows best, is to expose the R?fidah and raise the resolve of Ahlus-Sunnah to fight them and stop them. This is for several reasons: A) The R?fidah have declared a hidden war against the Muslims. They are the close and dangerous enemy to Ahlus-Sunnah. Even though the Americans are also a major enemy, but the R?fidah are more severely dangerous and more murderous towards the Ummah than the Americans … B) They took the Americans as allies, supported them, stood in their ranks in the face of the muj?hid?n, and sacrificed and continue to sacrifice for the Americans everything precious so as to end jih?d and the muj?hid?n. C) Our war against the R?fidah is a way to incite and raise the resolve of the Ummah for this battle. He ? also said elsewhere, It is not possible for the Muslims to achieve victory against the hostile kuff?r from the Jews and Christians except by abolishing those apostate agents – especially the R?fidah – near the Muslims. This is what history observed for us, as Baytul-Maqdis, which fell in the hands of the Crusaders with the aid of the Ubayd? R?fidah, was not taken back except at the hands of Sal?hudd?n, despite N?rudd?n Mahm?d being harsher against the Crusaders than Sal?hudd?n. But Allah ? declared that victory and liberation of Baytul-Maqdis would be upon the hands of Sal?hudd?n. But when? After he fought the Ubayd? R?fidah for years and completely abolished and destroyed their state. Thereafter, he dedicated his efforts to the war against the Crusaders until victory was achieved and he retook Baytul-Maqdis, which had been for years in the hands of the Crusaders due to the treachery of the R?fidah. This is a very important lesson that history presents to us. One should not be heedless of this lesson. We will never have victory against the asl? kuff?r8 except after also fighting murtadd kuff?r in addition to the asl? kuff?r. The Islamic victories that took place during the era of al-Khulaf?’ arR?shid?n came only after cleansing the Arabian Peninsula of the apostates [Hal At?ka Had?th ar-R?fidah].",,The Rafidah from Ibn Saba to the Dajjal

Dabiq,13,Dec-15,Jihadist,Abu Mus'ab az-Zarqawi,"Therefore, Shaykh az-Zarq?w? ? said, By recalling historical experiences, testimonies of past eras, signs of current events, and the experiences we live today, we will understand truly the meaning of {They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?} [Al-Mun?fiq?n: 4]. Throughout history, they have been a pang in the throats of the Muslims, a dagger in their backs, the rat that destroyed the dam, and the bridge over which the enemies of the Ummah pass. Shaykhul-Isl?m Ibn Taymiyyah spoke the truth when he described their condition after describing their takf?r of the Muslims, he ? said, For this reason, they help the kuff?r against the Muslim masses. They also helped the Mongols. They were one of the biggest reasons for Genghis Khan, the king of the kuff?r, invading the Muslim lands. They were also the reason for Hulagu Khan’s invasion of Iraq, taking of Aleppo, and plundering of as-S?lihiyyah. They also have many other treacheries they committed with their malice and deception. For this reason, they plundered the Muslim army as it travelled near them on its way back to Egypt after the first episode. For this reason, via armed robbery, they devastate the highways of the Muslims. For this reason, they supported the Mongols and the Franks against the Muslims. The biggest sorrow was manifested by them when Islam again became victorious. Similarly, when the Muslims conquered the shores of Akkah and its nearby regions, the R?fidah supported the Christians and preferred them to the Muslims … All that I described is just a part of their evil, whereas the matter is much greater. There is rancor and rage in their chests – the likes of which can be found in no other people’s hearts – directed to all ranks and levels of Muslims. According to them, the greatest act of worship is to curse the awliy?’ of Allah … The R?fidah are the people who strive the most to divide the Jam?’ah of the Muslims. One of their greatest principles is to make takf?r of and curse the best of the Muslim leaders like al-Khul?f?’ ar-R?shid?n and the scholars, because everyone who does not believe in the infallible nonexistent im?m has not believed in Allah and His Messenger ?. The R?fidah love the Mongols and their state, because through it they achieved honor the likes of which they could not achieve in a Muslim state. If the Muslims conquer the Christians and mushrik?n, it is a pang in the throats of the R?fidah. If the mushrik?n and Christians conquer the Muslims, it is a celebration and joy for the R?fidah’ [Majm?’ al-Fat?w?]. That ends his words, rahimahull?h. It is as if he lives amongst us describing what he witnessed with his own eyes, when he says, And likewise, if the Jews establish a state in Iraq or elsewhere, the R?fidah would be from their greatest supporters, because they always support the kuff?r from the mushrik?n, the Jews, and the Christians.

Dabiq,13,Dec-15,"Media, Politician, or Analyst","Time Magazine, Michael Morell","ISIS poses a major threat to the U.S. and to U.S. interests abroad, and that threat is growing every day. The nature and significance of the threat flow from the fact that ISIS is – all at the same time – a terrorist group, a state and a revolutionary political movement. We have never faced an adversary like it. As a terrorist group, ISIS poses a threat to the homeland. That threat is largely indirect and involves ISIS’s ability to radicalize young Americans to conduct attacks here. The FBI has over 900 open investigations into homegrown extremists, the vast majority radicalized by ISIS, and a large number of those investigations relate to individuals who may be plotting here… [T]he potential exists for the quantity of … [homegrown] attacks to be large. The number of ISIS followers dwarfs the number of followers that al-Qaeda ever had. Over time, the indirect threat, if not significantly degraded, will become a direct one – that is, ISIS will have the ability to plan and direct attacks on the homeland from the group’s safe havens in Iraq and Syria, just like it did in Paris. Such attacks are deeply concerning because they carry the potential to be much more sophisticated and complex – and therefore more dangerous – than homegrown attacks, again, just like in Paris recently, or London in 2005 or even 9/11. And in news that should get everyone’s attention, ISIS has shown an interest in weapons of mass destruction. The attacks in Paris were the first manifestation of an effort by ISIS to put together an attack capability in Europe – an effort it began less than a year ago. The head of the U.K.’s domestic security agency recently warned that ISIS is now planning mass-casualty attacks in Britain. His concerns are well-founded. We will not be far behind. As a state, ISIS poses a threat to regional stability – a threat to the very territorial integrity of the current nation-states, a threat to inflame the entire region in sectarian war… As a revolutionary political movement, ISIS is gaining affiliates among extremist groups around the world. They are signing up for what ISIS desires as its objective: a global caliphate where day-to-day life is governed by extreme religious views. In the mind of ISIS, its global caliphate would extend to the U.S. When they join ISIS, these affiliates evolve from focusing on local issues to focusing on establishing an extension of the caliphate. And their targets evolve from local to international ones. This is the story of the bombing of the Russian airline by an ISIS group in the Egyptian Sinai. ISIS has gained affiliates faster than al-Qaeda ever did. From none a year ago, there are now militant groups that have sworn allegiance to ISIS in nearly 20 countries. They have conducted attacks that have killed Americans, and they carry the potential to grab large amounts of territory… Morell ended his article saying: Mr. President, the downing of the Russian airliner and the attacks in Paris make it crystal clear that our ISIS strategy is not working.",,In the Words of the Enemy

We are a people of livestock, not a people of agriculture, complaining of an illness they contracted in al-Mad?nah. So Allah’s Messenger g ordered for them camels and a herdsman, and he ordered them to leave the city limits to drink the camels’ milk and urine (for its medicinal properties). They set out, but when they came to the edge of the volcanic rock field, they apostatized after having declared their Islam, killed the Prophet’s herdsman, and rode off with the camels. The news reached the Prophet g, so he sent trackers to find them. After they were found, he ordered that their eyes be gouged out with iron nails, their hands and feet be cut off, and they be left atop the volcanic rock field begging for water, which they would not be given, until they died in that condition",,Kill the Imams of Kufr in the West

For this purpose, he hosted the noble shaykh Muhammad al-Qumm? – one of the major scholars and leaders of the Sh?’ah – at the main Ikhw?n center [Al-Mulham al-Mawh?b]. He also said, During the forties, from what I recall, as-Sayyid al-Qumm? – who is a follower of the Sh?’? madhhab – stayed as a guest of the Ikhw?n at the main Ikhw?n center. At the time, Hasan al-Bann? worked hard to bring the different denominations closer to each other, so that the enemies of Islam do not take the division amongst the denominations as an opening by which they can tear up Islamic unity. We asked him one day about the degree of difference between Ahlus-Sunnah and the Sh?’ah, so he prohibited us from delving into such delicate matters that are inappropriate for the Muslims to busy themselves in, as the Muslims are… at the brink of a conflict the enemies of Islam want to ignite. We said to his nobleness, We don’t ask out of bigotry nor to widen the gap between the Muslims. We ask to know, because what is between the Sunnah and the Sh?’ah is mentioned in uncountable books and we don’t have the time to revisit these references.’ So he said, Know that Ahlus-Sunnah and the Sh?’ah are Muslims united by the word that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah’s Messenger. This is the basis of creed. The Sunnah and the Sh?’ah in this regards are equal and pure. As for the differences between them, then they are matters that continue to allow them to come closer together [Dhikr?y?t l? Mudhakkir?t]. At-Tilims?n? also said, The relationship of the Ikhw?n with the leaders of the Sh?’ah did not weaken. They contacted, for example, ?yatull?h al-K?sh?n?. They hosted Naww?b Safaw? in Egypt. The Ikhw?n did all this not to make the Sh?’ah abandon their madhhab. Rather, they did this for a noble goal to which their Islam calls. That is to attempt to bring the various Islamic denominations closer to each other, as much as possible [Sh?’ah wa Sunnah].",,The Murtadd Brotherhood

Dabiq,14,Apr-16,Jihadist,Abu Mus'ab as-Suri,"I will summarize what I have been guided to in the issue of creed and the issue of madhhab in the following points … Those many sects including the Sh?’ah…and other sects that say there is no god but Allah’ but leave the creed of Ahlus-Sunnah are still from the Ummah of Islam and the People of the Qiblah. Takf?r is not to be generalized upon them. Their ascription to Islam and the Qiblah should not be negated except according to scales and limits defined by the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah including the fulfillment of conditions and absence of impediments. This is the job of the expert scholars who have reached the degree of judging in creeds and faiths. This is not the job of individual Muslims including the ignorant and commoners amongst them. This is also not the job of those who have dedicated themselves to jih?d and fighting off the invaders [Da’wat al-Muq?wamah]. After falsely attributing his stance on the R?fidah to the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah2 , he went on to claim it was also the stance of the so-called majority of jih?dists, saying, The Issue of the Sh?’ah and Other Non-Sunn? Sects: The jih?dists consider all these sects to be within the Islamic Ummah or part of the People of the Qiblah … The Ja’far? Im?m? Sh?’ah: They are the majority of the Sh?’ah in Iran. They are minorities in Lebanon, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Mideast … The majority of the jih?dists consider them to be Muslims, from the People of the Qiblah, deviant, and mubtadi’ah [Da’wat al-Muq?wamah]. His deviance led him to declare the following in the alleged Jih?d? Creed and Constitution of the International Islamic Resistance Call, Article 10: The international Islamic resistance considers every Muslim who says there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger’ – regardless of their schools and denominations – to be within the general circle of Islam, which the scholars label the People of the Qiblah.’ It considers the theological, doctrinal, and denominational differences to be something for the scholars to judge. The solution for these matters is truthful discussion and clarification via wisdom and good admonishment … The resistance censures unrest and fighting amongst the Muslims. It calls all the Muslims of the Qiblah as schools, groups, and individuals to cooperate in resisting the invaders and waging jih?d against the k?fir enemy who invades the Muslims’ lands. It calls everyone to abandon the calls to internal partisanship, which only benefit in these circumstances the k?fir enemy invading the Muslims’ lands [Da’wat al-Muq?wamah].",,The Murtadd Brotherhood

Good greetings … I wanted to take the opportunity to say that the national bond uniting all the Egyptian citizens despite their various faiths does not need governmental arrangements and police protection. But we are before a coherent international conspiracy of vigorous parties. Zionism feeds this conspiracy to extract Palestine from the body of the Arab nation for whom Palestine is its throbbing heart. In front of this great surge of zealous emotions in Egypt and other lands of Arabism and Islam, we find it necessary to explain to you nobles and sons of the Jewish denomination from amongst our beloved citizens that the best defense is that you nobles and the figures from your denomination declare publically your material and moral participation with your fellow citizens from the sons of the Egyptian nation in their national resistance, a resistance which the Muslims and Christians have taken to save Palestine. Before it’s too late, you nobles should send this message to the United Nations, the Jewish Agency, and to all the international and Zionist organizations and committees who are concerned with this affair. You should let them know that the Jewish citizens of Egypt will be on the frontlines of the resistance to save the Arabism of Palestine. O people of nobility, you would thereby completely fulfill your national obligation. You would also remove any doubt that the bigots imply about the stance of Jewish Egyptian citizens. You would also give comfort to the whole nation and the Islamic peoples during the greatest hardship to face them in modern history. The nation and history will never forget this glorious stance.

Dabiq,14,Apr-16,Classical Scholar,Ibn Taymiyyah,"Ibn Taymiyyah r begins by stating the importance of deriving lessons from the events that afflicted the believers before us, and the necessity of comparing our situation with theirs. Indeed, there has occurred in this fitnah – by which Allah has afflicted the Muslims with this invading enemy who is outside the fold of the Shar?’ah of Islam – similar to what had occurred with the Muslims and their enemy in the time of Allah’s Messenger g … Allah’s covenants in His book and in the Sunnah of His Messenger encompass the last part of this Ummah just as they encompass its first part. Allah related the stories of the nations before us in order to serve as a lesson for us, so that we would compare our situation to their situation and measure the last nations according to the first nations. The shaykh then goes on to divide the people into three categories with respect to their support for Allah’s religion. And the victorious group – which is manifest upon the religion and not harmed by those who oppose or forsake it until the Day of Judgment – became apparent, for the people divided into three parties: A party striving in support of the religion, another forsaking it, and another outside the Shar?’ah of Islam … This test was a means of separation and division from Allah, {That Allah may reward the truthful for their truth and punish the hypocrites if He wills or accept their repentance. Indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful} [Al-Ahz?b: 24]. He then mentions some ?y?t about the Battle of Uhud in order to draw comparisons between the reason for the breakdown in the Muslim ranks during the Battle of Uhud, and the reason for the breakdown in the Muslim ranks during the course of the Mongol invasion. He says, Allah said, {Indeed, those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met, it was Shayt?n who caused them to slip because of some [blame] they had earned. But Allah has already forgiven them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing} [?l Imr?n: 155]. Allah c also said, {And Allah had certainly fulfilled His promise to you when you were killing the enemy by His permission until [the time] when you lost courage and fell to disputing about the order [given by the Prophet] and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you love. Among you are some who desire this world, and among you are some who desire the Hereafter. Then he turned you back from them [defeated] that He might test you. And He has already forgiven you, and Allah is the possessor of bounty for the believers} [?l Imr?n: 152]. Allah also said, {Why [is it that] when a [single] disaster struck you [on the day of Uhud], although you had struck [the enemy in the battle of Badr] with one twice as great, you said, From where is this?’ Say, It is from yourselves.’ Indeed, Allah is over all things competent} [?l Imr?n: 165]. [During the course of the battle,] the Shayt?n shouted to the people, Muhammad has been killed.’ So among them were those who were shaken and fled, and among them were those who stood firm and fought. So Allah said, {Muhammad is not but a messenger. [Other] messengers have passed on before him. So if he were to die or be killed, would you turn back on your heels [to unbelief]? And he who turns back on his heels will never harm Allah at all; but Allah will reward the grateful} [?l Imr?n: 144]. And this was similar to the condition of the Muslims when they broke down last year. He then mentioned that the defeat of the Muslims in his times was due to sins, bad intentions, boasting, conceitedness, etc., and then said, So it was out of Allah’s wisdom and His mercy upon the believers that He afflicted them with the trials He had afflicted them with, so that Allah may purify the believers and they may return to their Lord in repentance … Just as Allah’s support for the Muslims on the day of Badr was a mercy and a blessing and their defeat on the day of Uhud was a blessing and a mercy upon the believers, for indeed the Prophet g said, Allah does not decree anything for the believer except that it is good. And this is not for anyone except the believer.

It is also expanding the scopeof its operations to other regions. The terrorist attacks carried out in the final months of 2015 demonstrate that it is capable of committing attacks on…targets outside the territories under its control. The extent of its reach was notably demonstrated by the suicide bombings in Beirut on 12 November 2015, the coordinated attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015 and the attacks in Jakarta by an ISIL affiliate on 14 January 2016, which closely resembled the Paris attacks… The recent expansion of the ISIL sphere of influence across West and North Africa, the Middle East and South and South-East Asia demonstrates the speed and scale at which the gravity of the threat has evolved in just 18 months. The complexity of the recent attacks and the level of planning, coordination and sophistication involved raise concerns about its future evolution. Moreover, other terrorist groups…are sufficiently attracted by its underlying ideology to pledge allegiance to its so-called caliphate and self-proclaimed caliph. ISIL has also benefited from the arrival of a steady stream of foreign terrorist fighters, who continue to leave their communities to replenish its ranks. The return of these fighters from the battlefields of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic and other conflict zones is a further major concern, as returnees can extend the presence of ISIL to their States of origin and use their skills and combat experience to recruit additional sympathizers, establish terrorist networks and commit terrorist acts… The resolution of ongoing conflicts, including the Syrian conflict, would have a direct impact on the driving forces behind the recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters by ISIL … In order to address the grave threat posed by ISIL, including the influx of foreign terrorist fighters to Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic and ISIL’s extensive financing activities, it is essential to identify a political resolution to the Syrian conflict.

What is between his neck and collarbone is then made into metal, thus the Dajj?l finds no means to kill him. Therefore, he takes hold of him by his hand and feet and throws him.

And if not for your family, we would have stoned you [to death]; and you are not to us one respected.’ He said, O my people, is my family more respected for power by you than Allah?

Dabiq,15,Jul-16,Sira,Sirat Ibn Hisham,"The two representatives, Amr Ibn al-As and Abdullah Ibn Abi Rabi’ah, brought with them gifts for Ashamah and his patriarchs. They first presented their gifts to the patriarchs and explained to them the request they would make of Ashamah in the hopes that the patriarchs would support them and advise Ashamah to concede to their request. The patriarchs accepted the gifts and agreed to do so. The two representatives then entered into Ashamah’s presence, presented him with their gifts, and then spoke to him, saying, O king, indeed some foolish youth have taken refuge in your land. They have left the religion of their people and have not entered into your religion. They have come with a new religion that they have invented and which is not known to us or to you. We have been sent to you, with respect to them, by the dignitaries of our people, from among their fathers, their uncles, and their clans, so that you would return [these youth] to them, for they know them best and are more knowledgeable of that for which they fault them and admonish them. The patriarchs said, They have spoken truthfully, O king. Turn them over so that they can be returned to their people and their land. Ashamah, however, wanted to hear the other side of the story, so he summoned the Muslims and asked them, What is this religion over which you have left your people, and because of which you have not entered into my religion nor into any of these other religions? Ja’far ?, the one speaking on behalf of the Muslims, said, O king, we were an ignorant people who worshiped idols, ate animal carcasses, committed fornication, cut family ties, and harmed our neighbors; and the strong among us would devour the weak. We remained this way until Allah sent to us a messenger from among us whose lineage, truthfulness, trustworthiness, and chastity we knew. He called us to the oneness of Allah, ordering us to worship Him and abandon what we and our fathers were worshiping besides Him of stones and idols, and ordered us to be truthful in speech, to render trusts [to whom they are due], to mend family ties, to be good to our neighbors, and to withhold from forbidden matters and unlawful bloodshed, and he forbade upon us fornication, false speech, devouring an orphan’s wealth, and accusing chaste women of fornication. He commanded us to worship Allah alone and not make any partners for Him in worship and ordered us with prayer, zakah (charity), and fasting. So we affirmed his truthfulness and believed in him, and we followed him in what he had brought us of Allah’s religion. We worshiped Allah alone, not making any partners for Him, prohibited what he forbade upon us, and allowed what he permitted for us, so our people became hostile towards us. They tortured us and sought to turn us away from our religion through enticement and oppression in order to take us back to worshiping idols instead of Allah the Exalted, and to permitting the wicked things we used to permit. Thus, when they subjugated us, oppressed us, made things difficult for us, and stood between us and our religion, we left for your land. We chose you over others besides you, and we desired your protection and hoped that we would not be wronged in your presence, O king. Ashamah asked him, Do you have anything of that which he has come with from Allah? Ja’far replied, Yes. So Ashamah said, Then read it to me. So Ja’far read to him from the first section of Surat Maryam. Ashamah wept until his beard became wet and his patriarchs also wept until their books became wet when they heard what Ja’far recited to them. Ashamah then said, Indeed, this and what Jesus came with have come from the same lamp. He then told the two representatives from Quraysh, Go, for by Allah I will not surrender them to you and they will not be harmed. So they left, and Amr said to Abdullah, By Allah, tomorrow I will bring to him something from them by which I will uproot their joy The next day, Amr said to Ashamah, O king, they utter a tremendous statement concerning Jesus Son of Mary.1 So Ashamah summoned Ja’far and the Muslims with him and asked them what they say about Jesus. Ja’far said, We say about him like our prophet g taught us – that he is the slave of Allah, His messenger, His [chosen] spirit, and His word which He cast into the pure virgin Mary. Ashamah then picked up a cane and said, By Allah, Jesus Son of Mary does not exceed what you have mentioned so much as the length of this cane. His patriarchs then snorted, so he said to them, By Allah, even if you snort! (Sirat Ibn Hisham).",,The Response to the Call of the Prophet

By embracing Islam, he had effectively nullified his loyalty to the disbelievers and grasped the firm handhold of Islam, making it the only scale that would define his relationship with others. This became manifest when he cut off his ties to the Byzantine emperor, Heraclius, by cancelling the tribute he used to pay to him. Ibnul-Qayyim mentions that when the Prophet g sent Amr Ibn al-As to the two kings of Oman with his letter calling them to embrace Islam, Amr met with the younger of the two brothers ruling the land, answered several of his inquiries, and informed him that Ashamah had embraced Islam.2 The king stated his belief that the Byzantine emperor, Heraclius, was unaware of this, but Amr informed him that he was indeed aware of the fact. When he asked Amr how he came to know this, Amr informed him that Ashamah used to pay a tribute to Heraclius, but upon embracing Islam he ceased paying any further tributes, saying, No, by Allah!

Then, the first thing he asked me was, What is the status of his lineage amongst you?’ I said, He has a noble lineage among us.’ He said, Has anyone amongst you ever made this claim [of prophethood]?’ I said, No.’ He said, Was any of his forefathers a king?’ I said, No.’ He said, Is it the nobles who follow him or the weak?’ I said, It is the weak.’ He said, Do they continue to increase in number or decrease?’ I said, They increase.’ He said, Does anyone of them renounce his religion due to disliking it after having entered into it?’ I said, No.’ He said, Have you ever accused him of telling lies before he made his claim?’ I said, No.’ He said, Does he commit treachery?’ I said, No, but we are in a period of truce with him and do not know what he will do in it.’ I didn’t find any opportunity to say anything against him other than that. He then said, Have you battled him?’ I said, Yes.’ He said, What were the outcomes of your battles with him?’ I said, The war between us alternates back and forth; he afflicts us and we afflict him.’ He said, What does he order you with?’ I said, He tells us, Worship Allah alone and do not make any partners for Him, and leave what your forefathers used to say.’ He orders us with prayer, charity, truthfulness, chastity, and upholding family ties.’ He then said to his translator, Say to him, I asked you about his lineage and you mentioned that he has a noble lineage amongst you. Such is how the messengers are; they are from the noble lineages of their people. I asked you if anyone amongst you had ever made this claim [of prophethood] and you said, No.’ I had said to myself that if anyone had made this claim before him I would have thought he was just a man imitating something that had been said by someone else before him. I asked you if any of his forefathers had been a king and you said, No.’ I had said to myself that if any of his forefathers had been a king I would have thought he was a man seeking to reclaim his father’s kingdom. I asked you if you had ever accused him of telling lies before he had made his claim and you said, No,’ and I knew that he would not avoid telling lies about the people and then lie about Allah. I asked you if it were the nobles who followed him or the weak and you said it was the weak who followed him, and in fact, it is they who are typically the followers of the messengers. I asked you if they continued to increase in number or decrease and you said they continued to increase, and in fact, such is the matter of faith until it is completed. I asked you if anyone renounced his religion due to disliking it after having entered into it and you said, No,’ and such is faith when its delight enters the heart and mixes with it. I asked you if he committed treachery and you said, No,’ and likewise the messengers do not commit treachery. I asked you what he ordered you with and you said that he ordered you to worship Allah alone and not make any partners for Him, forbade you from worshiping idols, and ordered you with prayer, truthfulness, and chastity. If what you say is true then he will soon possess [the kingdom] beneath my feet. Indeed, I knew that he was to emerge but I did not think he would come from you (i.e. the Arabs). If I were certain that I could reach him I would hasten to meet him, and if I were with him I would wash his feet.’ He then called for the letter from Allah’s Messenger g – which he had sent with Dihyah to the leader of Busra who then forwarded it to Heraclius – and read it. The contents of the letter were as follows. In the Name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Heraclius, the leader of Rome: Peace be upon those who follow right guidance.’ As for what follows: Indeed, I call you with the call of Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be safe, and Allah will give you a double-reward. If you turn away, then upon you will be the sin of [misguiding] the peasants.’ Furthermore: O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you – that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah.’ But if they turn away, then say, Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him]’’ (Ali Imran 64).’ When he said what he said and finished reading the letter, the uproar increased and the people’s voices got louder, and we were made to leave. When we were turned out, I said to my companions, The matter of [Muhammad] has become grave. The king of the Romans fears him.’ I then remained certain that he would emerge victorious until Allah guided me to Islam. In considering the Prophet’s call, Heraclius wrote to his friend in Rome who was comparable to himself in his level of knowledge, and then set out traveling to Hims. Before he departed from Hims, he received a response from his friend in Rome, who agreed with his opinion that Muhammad g was indeed a prophet. So Heraclius summoned the Byzantine leaders to his palace in Hims and then ordered for the gates to be shut. He then addressed them, saying, O people of Rome, would you desire to attain success and guidance and for your kingdom to remain by pledging allegiance to this prophet? So they raced to the gates like wild donkeys and found them shut. When Heraclius saw them flee and lost hope of them accepting Islam, he said, Bring them back to me. He then told them, I only said what I said to test your commitment to your religion, and I have seen it. So they prostrated to him and were pleased with him, and this was the end of Heraclius’ story in relation to Islam",,The Response to the Call of the Prophet
Dabiq,15,Jul-16,Hadith,No Source Given,"Thus, the Roman emperor chose to reject the truth – after recognizing it clearly – and remain upon false- hood for fear of losing his kingdom and authority. Less than two years later, in the 8th year following the prophetic hijrah, the war between the Muslims and the Byzantine Empire would commence. The war that would continue for several years before the Byzantines were driven out of the Levant altogether, following their decisive defeat at the Battle of Yarmuk, and forced to retreat to their strongholds in Europe. Thus, Heraclius wound up losing much of his kingdom, before dying a few years later, despite having sacrificed his salvation in the Hereafter in a futile endeavor to preserve his rule. In the case of Jurayj, the Coptic king of Egypt, Ibnul-Qayyim mentions in Zad al-Ma’ad that the Prophet’s letter was carried to him by Hatib Ibn Abi Balta’ah h. The letter addressed him as follows: In the Name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful. From Muhammad, the slave of Allah, to Muqawqas, the leader of the Copts: Peace be upon those who follow right guidance. As for what follows: Indeed, I call you with the call of Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be safe. Embrace Islam and Allah will give you a double-reward. If you turn away, then upon you will be the sin of [misguiding] the Copts. O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you – that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him in worship and not take one another as lords instead of Allah.’ But if they turn away, then say, Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him]’’ (Ali Imran 64). Upon delivering the letter to him, Hatib advised him, saying, Indeed, there was a man before you who claimed that he was the Lord, Most High, so Allah seized him in exemplary punishment for the last and first [of his transgressions], punishing others by him and then punishing him. So take him as a lesson and do not let others take you as a lesson. He replied, Indeed, we have a religion which we will not leave except for that which is better than it. So Hatib said, We call you to Allah’s religion; it is the religion of Islam by which Allah compensates the abandonment of any other religion. Indeed, this prophet called the people [to Islam]. The harshest of the people towards him were [the tribe of] Quraysh, the most hostile towards him were the Jews, and the closest to [accepting] him were the Christians. I swear that Moses’s glad tidings of Jesus were but like Jesus’s glad tidings of Muhammad, and our calling you to the Qur’an is but like the calling of the people of the Torah (i.e. the Jews) to the Gospel. If any prophet reaches a people, they are from those to whom his message is addressed, so it is a duty upon them to obey him. And you are from among those whom this prophet has reached. We do not prevent you from the true religion of the Messiah, rather we order you with it.4  Despite Hatib’s good counsel, Jurayj declined the call of the Prophet g, but responded in a courteous manner, stating, Indeed, I have looked into the affair of this prophet and found that he does not command that which is disliked or prohibit that which is desired. I have not found him to be a misguided sorcerer or a lying soothsayer, and I have found the sign of prophethood with him by his revealing of that which is concealed and his informing of that which is discussed secretly, and so I will see. He then took the letter of the Prophet g and placed it in an ivory box, and then placed his seal upon it and handed it to one of his slave-girls. He then summoned one of his scribes to have him write the following letter to the Prophet g: In the Name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful. To Muhammad Ibn Abdillah from Muqawqas, the leader of the Copts: Peace be upon you. As for what follows. I have read your letter and understood what you have mentioned in it and what you call to. I have known that there remains a prophet [yet to come] and thought that he would emerge in the Levant. I have honored your messenger, and have sent to you two slave-girls who have a high status among the Copts, in addition to some garments, and have gifted you with a mule for you to ride. Peace be upon you. Thus, despite his well-mannered response, he did not accept Islam and instead chose to remain upon his disbelief. Upon receiving his letter and gifts, the Prophet g stated, The wicked man is clutching onto his kingdom, but his kingdom will not remain. Just a few years later, the Muslim expansion would reach Egypt during the Caliphate of Umar h, and the leader of the Muslim campaign in Egypt, Amr Ibn al-As h, would reach the gates of Alexandria and offer Jurayj one of three options: Islam, jizyah, or war. He elected to pay jizyah in humiliation, thereby bringing an end to his rule as he opted to remain living in peace – having been subjugated and dethroned – rather than entering into a prolonged state of war with the Muslims. Thus, the differing responses of these three Christian rulers to the call of the Prophet g brought with them varying fates. Ashamah chose Islam and thereby preserved his worldly life in addition to attaining eternal bliss in the Hereafter, whereas Jurayj and Heraclius rejected the call, each choosing a different option in an endeavor to preserve what he could of his worldly life. Jurayj chose to pay jizyah in the hopes of avoiding imminent bloodshed and slavery and achieving some peace, albeit in a state of humiliation and dethronement. Heraclius, meanwhile, chose war, hoping to thereby fend off any encroachment on his position and wealth. Each sought to preserve his trifle allotment of the worldly life while forfeiting his salvation in the Hereafter, but instead, each of them wound up losing both. These are the same choices placed before the disbelieving Christians today. They have the option of trying to cling to the transient luxuries of this life, rejecting the truth in favor of either paying jizyah to the Islamic State or continuing to wage a futile war against it. Alternatively, they can heed the warning of Allah that the worldly life is not guaranteed even for those who pursue it at the expense of their salvation, and thus choose to embrace Islam, champion the truth, attain the mercy of their Lord, and enter the Gardens of Paradise.",,The Response to the Call of the Prophet

For this reason, it was reported that Nuh ? ordered his sons with la ilaha illallah’ and subhanallah,’ and forbade them from arrogance and shirk (Reported by Ahmad from Abdullah Ibn Amr) … This is because the one who is too haughty to worship Allah does not worship Him and therefore does not submit to Him, and the one who worships Him and also worships other than Him is making partners for Him and he is therefore not exclusively for Him. Rather, he has shirk towards Him.

Such means also represent a frightening crack in the wall of political stability and an unacceptable uprising against the true legitimacy of the society. If the atmosphere of suppression and volatility that controls the nation has implicated a group of its sons in practicing terrorism, frightening the innocent, and agitating the country and its economic and political progress, then the Muslim Brotherhood announces without any hesitation and appeasement that it is innocent of all forms and roots of violence. It censures all forms and roots of terrorism. It announces that those who spill inviolable blood or partake in such are partners in and perpetrators of sin. They are requested with firmness and without delay to return to the truth … As for those who intentionally mix up the facts and wrongly accuse the Muslim Brotherhood of partaking in violence and being implicated in terrorism – under the claim that the Brotherhood insistently requests the government not to respond to violence with further violence and instead to adhere to the law and judicial system and comprehend all the causes and circumstances behind violence in the government’s study and response to the phenomenon without relying only on security responses – then such claims against the Brotherhood are rejected by the very bright history of the Brotherhood throughout the long years in which the Brotherhood partook in representative councils and legislative elections.

Rumiyah,2,Oct-16,Jihadist,The Central Office OQur'aneing Shar'i Dawawin,"The memorandum on the ruling of those who refrain from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam begins by presenting two positions both being incorrect due to excess on one hand and negligence on the other, defining the term asl ad-din (the foundation of the religion) used in both as that by which tawhid is established before the advent of the prophetic proof. The first position presented was that whoever refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, is a mushrik exactly like them, because making takfir of them is part of asl ad-din. So the refrainer is exactly like those who worship others besides Allah, and he is absolutely one of them in both name and ruling. The second position presented after was that takfir is not part of asl ad-din, but is one of its inferred requirements. So the one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, has not disbelieved until the hujjah (evidenced argument) is established against him, all shubuhat (doubts) are removed, and his tawil (misinterpretation) is eliminated. The memorandum then explains that the first claim implies a corrupt concept, because major shirk has a reality and description that, if actualized, designates the one who possesses it a mushrik. If we were to absolutely equate the one who refrains from takfir with the one who worships others besides Allah, then making takfir of the one who refrains from making takfir of the refrainer would be absolutely necessitated, since major shirk is not excused by ignorance and the refrainer (according to the first claim) is a mushrik exactly like the initial person [the mushrik worshiping others besides Allah]. And the one who refrains thereafter [from making takfir of the other refrainers in the chain] is also a mushrik [exactly like the initial person], and so on. This is the actual inference – not an imagined understanding – of this claim’s line of reasoning. This line of reasoning leads to making chain-takfir, an invalid bid’ah that can never be controlled and that originates from an incorrect understanding of the texts. This claim is rejected due to the invalidity of its inference. The memorandum goes on to explain that the second claim also implies a corrupt concept, as it makes takfir of the mushrikin like one of the masail khafiyyah (obscure issues), for which it is impossible to establish the hujjah and impossible to make takfir of the refrainer as long as he has some shubhah (doubt) or tawil. The essence of this claim is the annulment of an agreed upon nullifier of Islam. Whereas, the existence of shubhah is a passing matter that must be eliminated… As for making this passing matter a foundation upon which rulings are based, then this would result in the annulment of these rulings and the nullification of what it means to manifest the religion. This is in opposition to what is transmitted from the imams of the religion, including the imams of the Najdi da’wah ?. The memorandum then explains that it is wrong to use the terms asl (foundational basis) and lazim (required inference) with regards to the meaning of la ilaha illallah’ and kufr bit-taghut in an argumentative manner. That is because doing so is a fruitless, invented assertion with which Allah did not burden us. Rather, multiple corrupt inferences necessarily result therefrom, like excluding certain matters established by the advent of the prophetic proof from being part of asl ad-din – in accordance with this definition – and thus excluding belief in the prophethood of Muhammad ? from asl ad-din! Likewise, it leads to disputation … regarding what is included in the meaning of asl ad-din and what is excluded from it. The memorandum then quotes Shaykh Sulayman Ibn Abdillah Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahhab ?, who was asked about a similar issue, regarding wala and bara, if such were from the meaning of la ilaha illallah’ or from its inferred requirements? Shaykh Sulayman ? responded, The answer is to say that Allah knows best. But it is sufficient for a Muslim to know that Allah made it a duty upon him to take the mushrikin as enemies and to not take them as awliya, and He made it obligatory to love the believers and to take them as awliya. He made this an essential of iman, just as He negated the iman of whoever shows love to those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers, sons, brothers, or tribesmen. As for wala and bara being from the meaning of la ilaha illallah’ or from its inferred requirements, then Allah did not burden us with researching this. He only burdened us with knowing that Allah made wala and bara a duty and obligation and that He obligated acting on the basis of wala and bara. This, undoubtedly, is what is obligatory and necessary. Thereafter, whoever knows whether wala and bara are from the meaning of la ilaha illallah’ or from its inferred requirements, then knowing such is fine and an added benefit. But whoever does not know such, is not burdened to know. This is especially so if the argument or dispute over the matter leads to evil, conflict, and discord among the believers – those who upheld the obligations of iman, waged jihad for Allah’s sake, took the mushrikin as enemies, and took the Muslims as awliya. Therefore, remaining silent on such matters that lead to division is definitely obligatory. This is what is apparent to me. Nevertheless, the two sides are similar in meaning. And Allah knows best (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah). The memorandum then addresses another term, in addition to those mentioned before, stating that it is unacceptable to use the term takfir al-adhir (takfir of the excuser) to describe the ruling of the one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, because it is an inaccurate term. While we reject ignorance as an excuse for major shirk, this innovated opinion (of excusing – for ignorance – those claimants of Islam who commit major shirk) does not necessitate that every excuser refrains from making takfir, as there are those of them who might consider ignorance an excuse, but who do indeed make takfir of the mushrikin because he considers the hujjah to have been established against them, so he is therefore not a refrainer. Likewise, refraining from making takfir of the mushrikin is not confined to the issue of excusing them due to their ignorance, as it is possible one might refrain from making takfir of them out of his arrogance, defiance, following of desires, or citing of general texts indicating the merits of la ilaha illallah.’ So the term takfir al-adhir does not accurately describe the one who refrains from making takfir of the mushrikin, such a refrainer being the one whom the scholars meant by this nullifier. The memorandum continues, stating, The one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam commits an agreed upon nullifier, but his kufr is based upon establishment of the proof, unlike the one who worships others besides Allah. Making takfir of the mushrikin is an issue established by apparent and numerous texts, which all people can understand. Establishing the argument thereof is by the Quran’s advent, by either it being conveyed to the people or them having the ability to reach it. Allah ? said, Say, What thing is greatest in witness?’ Say, Allah is a witness between me and you, and this Quran has been inspired unto me that by it I might warn you and whomever it reaches’ (Al-An’am 19). The mujaddid Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahhab ? said, Know that the evidences for making takfir of the otherwise righteous Muslim who commits shirk with Allah or sides with the mushrikin against the muwahaddin, even if he does not commit shirk, are more than one can compile from the speech of Allah,1 the words of His Messenger, and the statements of the scholars’ (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah). Shaykh Abdul-Latif Ibn Abdir-Rahman Ibn Hasan ? said, It should be known that the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger, and the statements of the scholars are explicit, abundant, and manifest in making takfir of anyone who supplicates others besides Allah and calls upon them for something only Allah can do … The entire Quran demonstrates and confirms this in various manners and expressions that explain this and make note of it’ (Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah). Other scholars of the Najdi da’wah said, The one who does not make takfir of the mushrikin has not accepted the teachings of the Quran to be true. The Quran has made takfir of the mushrikin and has ordered making takfir of them, taking them as enemies, and fighting against them’ (Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah). However, this matter could become somewhat obscure with regards to some mushrikin who claim Islam, due to the spread of ignorance, the weakness of da’wah, and the circulation of shubuhat. Here, the proof is established by demonstrating the clear texts evidencing the kufr of these mushrikin. If someone refrains after this clarification, he becomes a kafir. Shaykh Sulayman Ibn Abdillah ? said, If someone doubts their kufr or is ignorant of it, the evidences proving their kufr from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger ? are to be presented to him. After this, if he doubts or hesitates, then he is a kafir according to the ijma’ of the scholars, since the one who doubts the kufr of a kafir is himself a kafir’ (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah). But if their matter becomes manifest by the religion mounting, its voice rising, and its da’wah being conveyed… then there is no consideration given to any shubhah that would suspend the legal ruling. This is what is known from the imams of guidance, like those of the Najdi da’wah who faced this issue and died upon goodness. Some of the imams of the da’wah ? said, Whoever does not make takfir of the mushrikin of the Ottoman State and the grave worshipers like the people of Makkah and others who worship righteous people, who deviate from the tawhid of Allah to shirk, and who replace the Sunnah of His Messenger ? with heresies, then he is a kafir just like them, even if he hates their religion, despises them, and loves Islam and the Muslims. For the one who does not make takfir of the mushrikin has not accepted the teachings of the Quran to be true. The Quran has made takfir of the mushrikin and has ordered making takfir of them, taking them as enemies, and fighting against them’ (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah).",,Important Memorandums
Rumiyah,2,Oct-16,Jihadist,The Central Office OQur'aneing Shar'i Dawawin,"The memorandum stated, The Organization of alQa’idah in Syria (Jabhat an-Nusrah’) and those groups with it in the encampment of factions whom the Islamic State fights are parties forcefully resisting the implementation of Allah’s Shari’ah, parties who have assisted the apostates aiming at establishing a democratic civil’ kufri state. They fight together in one trench against an Islamic state, which no one doubts rules by the Shari’ah, incite others to fight against it by all means, and strive to displace its authority from the land, thereby replacing the Shari’ah of Allah, which it upholds, with jahili rulings and man-made laws. All of this is done with the air cover of the Crusader campaign against the Islamic Khilafah. These nawaqid (nullifiers of Islam) and others have been committed by all of the factions who claim Shari’ah and jihad but have remained in the camp of the apostates who fight the army of the Khilafah. These factions claiming Shari’ah and jihad did not withdraw from the apostate camp and declare their disassociation from them and their kufr, rather, they joined their alliances and supported them… The Islamic State has manifested the ruling of the Shari’ah regarding these factions, leaving no room thereby for any doubters. The Islamic State manifested that these factions are apostate parties who have openly committed kufr and whose condition has become evident, in a way that establishes hujjah and severs any shubhah an ignorant person might have. This includes what is found in the memorandum released by the Delegated Committee… 2 As such, it will not be accepted that any of our troops is found refraining from making takfir of the individuals from the parties who fight us and whom we fight over Allah’s Shari’ah.

The condition of these factions will be explained to him if he is ignorant thereof.

Do you not see that if a carpet seller, a weaver, a carpenter, and a builder were to enter into a nice home, you would see the carpet seller looking at the rugs and reflecting on their value, the weaver looking at the textiles, the carpenter looking at the wood of the home, and the builder looking at the walls? The believer is likewise – if he sees darkness, he remembers the darkness of the grave, if he hears a terrifying sound, he remembers the blowing of the trumpet [on the Day of Judgment], if he sees something blissful, he remembers the bliss of Jannah, and if he sees torment, he remembers the Hellfire (Mukhtasar Minhaj al-Qasidin).",,The Flames of Justice

The meeting was a scene manifesting at the proper time the greatness and power of Islam to dissolve…sectarian differences. Im?m Khomeini honored the delegation and made it clear to it that he was certain during his exile that his reserves were the reserves of the Islamic revolution worldwide, his reserves being every muwahhid Muslim who says there is no god but Allah. He said that the revolution was not only for Iran, but also for every Islamic state whose ruler transgresses against the Islamic religion and stands in the way of its dynamic movement and that Allah who blessed Khomeini with victory against the Shah would support every Khomeini against every Shah. The delegation also stressed from its side to Im?m Khomeini that the Islamic movements would continue to uphold their pledge in serving the Islamic revolution in Iran and everywhere with all their human, scholarly, and material ability. After the delegation prayed the gh?’ib funeral prayer for the [R?fid?] shuhad?’, a number of meetings were held … The meetings focused on future coordination and cooperation … The delegation later made a call – during a touching television interview – to a day of solidarity with the Iranian revolution all over the Islamic world and wherever there are Islamic communities and gatherings outside it.

Rumiyah,6,Feb-17,Classical Scholar,Ibn Taymiyyah,"He answered, saying, All praise is due to Allah. Regarding their celebrations, it is not permissible for Muslims to resemble them in anything: not in their food, their clothing, their bathing, their lighting of candles, the abandoning of one’s work or worship, or otherwise. It not permissible to prepare a meal or give gifts, nor to sell that which assists them in doing any of that, nor to allow children or others to play games specific to these celebrations, nor to dress up [for them]. Overall, Muslims must not give special consideration to [kafir] celebrations at all. Rather, those days of festivity should be – to the Muslims – just like any other day. A Muslim’s intentionally giving consideration to one of these days [by doing something special without actually intending to celebrate the occasion itself] was disliked by groups of the Salaf and the Khalaf. As for his specifically doing anything of what was mentioned above [in celebration of the occasion], then there is no dispute about it amongst the scholars. Rather, some scholars considered that whoever does such things has committed kufr, since doing so involves holding the religious activities of kufr with esteem. Others have said that whoever slaughters a ram on a day of their celebrations, it is as if he slaughtered a pig. Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-As said, Whoever lives in the lands of the non-Arabs, celebrates their New Year’s and festivals, and resembles them until he dies upon such, he will be resurrected with them on the Day of Resurrection.’ More than one of the Salaf said about Allah’s saying, Those who do not bear witness to falsehood’ (Al-Furqan 72), that it refers to the celebrations of the kuffar. If such is the case of merely witnessing them, then what about participating in them by doing that which is specific to them? It was reported from the Prophet g that he said, Whoever resembles a people, then he is from them,’ (Reported by Ahmad from Ibn Umar) and in another wording, He is not from us, the one who resembles other than us,’ (Reported by at-Tirmidhi from Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-As) and it is a jayyid’ hadith. So if this is said of resembling them, even if only in customs, then what about resembling them in something more obvious than that? The majority of imams disliked – whether to the point of tahrim or just that of a lesser degree – eating what was slaughtered for their celebrations or their religious offerings, as they grouped that with what is dedicated to other than Allah or what is sacrificed on an altar. Likewise, they forbade supporting them in their celebrations by giving them gifts or selling things to them [for that occasion]. They said that it is not permissible for the Muslims to sell the Christians anything that benefits their celebration: not meat, not blood, not a garment, not giving them a ride, and not supporting them in anything of their religion. That is because doing so is to give esteem to their shirk and to help them commit kufr. The authorities should forbid the Muslims from doing this, as Allah c said, Assist one another upon duty and piety, and do not assist one another upon sin and transgression’ (Al-Maidah 2). Furthermore, just as it is not allowed for the Muslim to help them drink wine, whether by pressing grapes for them or otherwise, then what about helping them uphold their rites of kufr? And if he himself is not allowed to help them do that – then what if he himself is the one doing it?! And Allah knows best (Majmu’ al-Fatawa).",,Shedding Light on the Blessed Operation in Instanbul

Rumiyah,7,Mar-17,Qur'an,Fatir 28,Only those of His slaves who have knowledge fear Allah (Fatir 28),,Only Those of His Slaves with Knowledge Fear Allah
Rumiyah,7,Mar-17,Classical Scholar,Ibn Taymiyyah,"Ibn Taymiyyah ? said, The meaning is that none fears Him except a scholar, for Allah has informed us that everyone who fears Allah is a scholar, as He stated in another ayah: Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing [in prayer], mindful of the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]? Say, Are those who know equal to those who do not know?’ It is only the people of understanding who will remember’ (Az-Zumar 9). Fear always comprises hope, and if not for that it would have been security. So those who fear Allah and have hope in Him are the people of knowledge whom Allah has aided. It has been narrated that Abu Hayyan at-Taymi said, The scholars are of three types: One who is knowledgeable of Allah but not knowledgeable of Allah’s affair, one who is knowledgeable of Allah’s affair but not knowledgeable of Allah, and one who is knowledgeable of Allah and knowledgeable of Allah’s affair. The one who is knowledgeable of Allah is the one who fears Him, and the one who is knowledgeable of Allah’s affair is the one who knows His commands and prohibitions.’ Likewise, the Prophet ? said, Indeed, I hope to be the most fearful of Allah among you and the most knowledgeable of that which he is mindful of’ (Reported by Muslim from Aishah). If those who fear Allah are the scholars, who are praised in the Book and the Sunnah, then they do not deserve to be disparaged, and this is only the case if they perform the obligatory deeds. This is indicated by the statement of Allah ?, So their Lord inspired to them, We will surely destroy the wrongdoers. And We will surely cause you to dwell in the land after them. That is for he who fears My position and fears My threat’’ (Ibrahim 13-14). This is also indicated by His statement, And for he who fears the position of his Lord are two gardens’ (Ar-Rahman 46). So He promised victory in the Dunya and reward in the Hereafter for those who feared Him, and this is only because they performed what was obligatory upon them. This is evidence that fear necessitates the performance of that which is obligatory, and for this reason it is said that an immoral person does not fear Allah. The evidence for this is the statement of Allah ?, The repentance accepted by Allah is only for those who do wrong in ignorance [or carelessness] and then repent soon after’ (An-Nisa 17). Abul-Aliyah said, I asked the companions of Muhammad about this ayah, and they said, Everyone who disobeys Allah is ignorant, and anyone who repents before death has repented soon after [his sin].’’ And the rest of the scholars of tafsir have stated likewise. Mujahid said, Every sinner is ignorant at the time of committing his sin.’ Likewise, al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ata, as-Suddi, and others have said, They were only called ignorant due to their sins, and not because they couldn’t distinguish [between good and evil].’ Az-Zajjaj said, The meaning of the ayah isn’t that they were ignorant of it being something evil, because if a Muslim commits a sin that he is ignorant of, he is like one who has not committed any evil. So it is only one of two possibilities: The first is that they committed it while ignorant of the disliked matter it contains. The second is that they committed it while knowing and comprehending that its consequence is disliked, preferring what they would gain from it immediately over what they would gain in the Hereafter [from leaving it], and as such they were called ignorant for preferring that which is little over abundant comfort and permanent wellbeing.’ Here, az-Zajjaj has made ignorance to be either not knowing the consequence of the deed, or being corrupt in what one desires. It might be said that these two things are related, and this is further expounded on in the discussion about the Jahmiyyah. What is intended here is that everyone who disobeys Allah is ignorant, and anyone who fears Him is a scholar who is obedient to Allah, and one only becomes ignorant due to a decrease in his fear of Allah, because if one’s fear of Allah had been complete he would not have sinned. Likewise, there is the statement of Ibn Mas’ud ?, It is sufficient in terms of knowledge for one to fear Allah, and it is sufficient in terms of ignorance for one to be deceived concerning Allah.’ This is because envisioning the object of one’s fear necessitates fleeing from it, and envisioning the object of one’s love necessitates seeking it, so if one does not flee from the first and does not seek the second, it indicates that he has not envisioned it completely. He might, however, envision what is reported about it, but envisioning what is reported, affirming it, and memorizing its letters is not the same as envisioning that which is being reported about. Likewise is the case if he neither loves nor hates that which he envisions, for the human being may affirm that which is feared and loved by others, and this does not provoke him into fleeing from it, nor does it motivate him to seek it. Likewise is the case if he is informed of that which he loves or hates, and does not deny the one informing him – rather, he recognizes his truthfulness – but his heart is too busy with other matters to envision that which he has been informed of, and as such he neither flees from it nor seeks it. In the well-known statement from al-Hasan al-Basri, which has also been attributed to the Prophet ?, Knowledge is of two types, knowledge in the heart and knowledge on the tongue. The knowledge of the heart is the beneficial knowledge, and the knowledge of the tongue is Allah’s hujjah against His slaves.’ Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported in the Sahihayn from Abu Musa that the Prophet ? said, The example of a believer who recites the Quran is like a citron: its taste is pleasant and its fragrance is pleasant. The example of a believer who does not recite the Quran is like a date: its taste is pleasant and it has no fragrance. The example of a munafiq who recites the Quran is like basil: its fragrance is pleasant but its taste is bitter. The example of a munafiq who does not recite the Quran is like a colocynth: its taste is bitter and it has no fragrance.’ This munafiq who recites the Quran, memorizes it, and envisions its meanings, may affirm that it is the speech of Allah and that the Messenger is true, but he is not a believer, just as the Jews recognize him as easily as they recognize their own sons, but regardless are not believers, and likewise Iblis, Fir’awn, and others. And whoever is like that has not attained a thorough degree of knowledge, for this undoubtedly necessitates performing what it obligates, and because of that, anyone who didn’t work in accordance with his knowledge would be called ignorant, as was previously mentioned. Likewise, with respect to the term intellect,’ many experts considered it to be a type of knowledge, therefore, it must be counted as a form of knowledge and dealt with according to its requirements. As such, none can be called intelligent except for those who know what is good and seek it, and who likewise know what is evil and abandon it. For this reason, the people of Hell say, If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze’ (Al-Mulk 10). Likewise, Allah ? said concerning the munafiqin, You think they are together, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who do not reason’ (Al-Hashr 14). He who does what he knows will harm him has no intelligence. So just as the fear of Allah necessitates having knowledge of Him, having knowledge of Him in turn necessitates fearing Him, and likewise fearing Him necessitates obeying Him. Therefore, he who fears Allah will carry out His commands and shun His prohibitions, and this is what we intended to first clarify. What indicates this also is the statement of Allah ?, So remind, if the reminder should benefit. He who fears [Allah] will be reminded. But the wretched one will avoid it – [he] who will [enter and] burn in the greatest Fire’ (Al-A’la 9-12). So He informed us that he who fears Him will be reminded, and being reminded here necessitates worshiping Him. Allah ? said, It is He who shows you His signs and sends down to you from the sky, provision. But none will remember except he who turns back [in repentance]’ (Ghafir 13). He also said, Giving insight and a reminder for every servant who turns [to Allah]’ (Qaf 9). For this reason, with regards to Allah’s statement, He who fears [Allah] will be reminded,’ the scholars of tafsir said that it means he who fears Allah will take lesson from the Quran,’ and concerning Allah’s statement, But none will remember except he who turns back [in repentance],’ they said that it means only he who returns to obedience will take lesson.’ This is because if one remembers in a complete manner, it necessitates that he be affected by what he remembers, such that if he remembers that which is beloved to him he seeks it, and if he remembers that which he fears he flees from it. And in this regard there is the statement of Allah ?, It is all the same for them whether you admonish them or do not admonish them – they will not believe’ (Al-Baqarah 6). Allah ? also said, You can only admonish one who follows the message and fears the Most Merciful in secret’ (Yasin 11). So Allah denied admonishment for these people in His statement, It is all the same for them whether you admonish them or do not admonish them – they will not believe.’ On one hand, He established their admonishment, and on the other hand He denied their admonishment, because admonishment is to inform one of that which he fears. Therefore, admonishment is like teaching a person and scaring him. If you teach someone and they learn, then you have taught them. But it may also be the case that you teach someone and they don’t learn. Likewise, if you scare someone and they become afraid, then the goal of scaring them has been achieved. But if you scare someone and they don’t become afraid, then the goal of scaring them has not been achieved. And likewise, if you guide someone and they become guided, then their guidance has been achieved, and in this regard there is the statement of Allah ?, A guidance for the pious’ (Al-Baqarah 2). If, however, you guide someone and they don’t become guided, as in Allah’s statement, And as for Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness over guidance’ (Fussilat 17), then in such a case their guidance has not been achieved, just as you would say, I cut him and he was cut,’ and I cut him but he wasn’t cut.’ So something that has a complete effect necessitates that one be affected by it, and if its effect doesn’t occur, then it isn’t complete. Likewise, if a deed encounters a receptive place, its effect is achieved, and if it does not, then its effect is not achieved. Furthermore, having knowledge of that which a person loves will lead him to seek it, and having knowledge of that which a person hates will lead him to abandon it. For this reason, this knowledge is referred to as the caller,’ and it is said, The presence of the caller along with the presence of one’s capability, necessitates the presence of that which one is capable of attaining, which is to have knowledge of what is being sought. This knowledge in turn necessitates that a person desires the object of his knowledge. And all this can only be attained with a pure and upright fitrah (natural disposition). If, however, the fitrah is corrupt, a person may perceive that which is pleasurable but not find it to be pleasurable at all, and may instead find it to be painful. Likewise, he may find what is painful to be pleasurable due to the corruption of his fitrah. Corruption overcomes a person’s mental faculties as well as his physical faculties, such as in the case of a fool who finds honey to be bitter – his very sensations have been corrupted to the extent that he perceives honey in a manner that is opposite to how it actually is because of the one time that it was mixed with something bitter. And this is likewise in the case of an individual whose interior has become corrupt, as Allah ? said, And what will make you perceive that even if a sign came, they would not believe. And We will turn away their hearts and their eyes just as they refused to believe in it the first time’ (Al-An’am 109-110).",,Only Those of His Slaves with Knowledge Fear Allah

This is just as He ? said, Is not Allah sufficient for His slave?’ (Az-Zumar 36). And whoever clings to sorcery and devils, then Allah will leave him to them, and they will destroy him in the Dunya and in the Akhirah. In general, whoever relies on other than Allah, whatever it may be, is left to it and he will see evil in the Dunya and the Akhrirah coming at him from its direction, contrary to his expectance. This is the irreplaceable sunnah and unchangeable work of Allah regarding His slaves, that whoever seeks comfort in other than Him, puts his trust in other than Him, or depends on something created to manage his affairs, then Allah will cause that thing to do the opposite of what he hoped from it. This is known through revelation and experience, and whoever reflects deeply over this and the conditions of the creation will see it clearly (Taysir al-Aziz al-Hamid). He also said, The act of clinging’ can be of the heart, through action, or both. That is, one who clings to something with his heart, or clings to something with his heart and action, then he is left to it, meaning Allah leaves him to that thing to which he clung. So whoever attaches himself to Allah, seeks Allah’s aid for his need, takes refuge with Him, and entrusts all of his affairs to Him, then He suffices for him every need, brings close to him what is distant, and makes easy for him what is difficult. And whoever clings to other than Him or relies on his knowledge, his intellect, medicine, or amulets, and depends on his might and power, then Allah leaves him to that and abandons him. This is known through the texts and through experience. Allah ? said, Whoever relies upon Allah, then He is sufficient for him’ (At-Talaq 3)… Wahb Ibn Munabbih said, Allah ? inspired to Dawud, O Dawud, by My might and My greatness, none of My slaves adheres to Me instead of My creation – which I know from his intention – and then the seven heavens and all those therein, and the seven earths and all those therein plot against him, except that I would make a way out for him.

I excuse myself to You from what these [the Muslims] have done and I am innocent before You of what these [the mushrikin] have done.’ He then went forth and met Sa’d Ibn Mu’adh and said, O Sa’d Ibn Mu’adh! Jannah, by the Lord of an-Nadr! Jannah, by the Lord of an-Nadr! I can smell it near Uhud!’ Sa’d later said, O Messenger of Allah, I could not do what he did.’ Anas said, We found on his body some eighty-odd marks from swords, spears, and arrows. He was killed and the mushrikin had mutilated his body. No one even recognized him, except his sister, who recognized his fingertips. We thought that this ayah was revealed due to him and those like him: Among the believers are men true to what they promised Allah.

Rumiyah,9,May-17,Classical Scholar,Ibn al-Qayyim,"Ibnul-Qayyim r considered some of these wisdoms in Zad al-Ma’ad, saying: Of them is that this is a trait of the messengers, just as Hiraql told Abu Sufyan, asking him, Have you fought him? He said, Yes, He said, How was the war between you and him? He said, In turns – he defeats us sometimes and we defeat him sometimes. He said, And likewise the messengers are afflicted, then the final outcome shall be theirs (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). Of them is that the truthful believer is distinguished from the deceitful munafiq, for indeed after Allah gave victory to the Muslims over their enemies on the Day of Badr and their reputation increased, and there were those who entered into Islam only outwardly but not inwardly, Allah’s ? wisdom came to bring about a test for His slaves, through which the Muslim would be distinguished from the munafiq. The munafiqin showed themselves in this battle, speaking that which their hearts previously concealed, displaying their erroneous way, as their mere gesturing turned into explicit speech – and the people were clearly divided: believer, disbeliever, and munafiq. And the believers recognized that they had an enemy amongst them, an enemy that would not leave them; so they prepared for them and took their guard against them. Of them is that if Allah c always supported the believers and gave them victory over their enemy in every battle, giving them consolidation over their enemies in every case, their souls would transgress and become arrogant and proud. They would be with support and victory in the same situation as they are with any provision. But His slaves are not rectified except through good times and bad times, hardship and ease, and poverty and wealth, and Allah manages the affairs of His slaves according to His wisdom – and He is Aware of them and Watchful over them. Of them is that the servitude of His allies and His party is brought out during good times and bad times, during that which they love and that which they hate, in the state of their victory and that of their enemies. So if they remain steadfast upon worshipful obedience in what they love and hate, they are truly His slaves, unlike one who worships Allah only during good, blessed, and healthy times. Of them is that when He tests them with defeat and being conquered, they are humiliated, divided, and subdued, until they seek His might and support. For the removal of support only brings about the rule of humiliation and division. Allah c said, Allah had given you victory at Badr while you were few in number (Al Imran 123), and He said, On the day of Hunayn, when your great number pleased you, but it did not avail you at all (At-Tawbah 25). For if He c wants to bolster, support, and mend His slave, He breaks him first. And His mending him, bolstering him, and support for him, is all in accordance with how much he faced of humiliation and division. Of them is that Allah c prepared for His believing slaves homes in the abode of His generosity – their deeds will not reach them, but they will only come to them through trial and tribulation. So He will send to them the means by which they will reach these homes by ordaining tests and trials for them. Likewise, He grants them success in accomplishing righteous deeds, which are also amongst these means. Of them is that souls gain lasting health, support, and sufficiency through transgression and haste. Such is a sickness that impairs them from seriously moving towards Allah and the Akhirah. If their Lord, their Owner, and their Giver of Mercy wanted them to receive His honor, He decreed for them to be tested and tried as a treatment to that impairing sickness. As such, these trials and tribulations are like the physician who gives his patient some unpleasant medicine in order to remove his ailments – and if he left him alone, these ailments would overcome him and lead to his demise. Of them is that shahadah (martyrdom) according to Allah is of the highest ranks for His allies. The shuhada are His special people, those brought close from amongst His slaves. There is no rank after that of the siddiqin except shahadah, and He c loves to take His slaves as shuhada, having their blood shed for His love and contentment, while they prefer His pleasure and love over their own selves. There is no way to achieve this rank except through those means that would lead to dominating the enemy. (End quote). Allah ? says, Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah knows, while you know not (Al-Baqarah 216).",,"And Likewise the Messengers Are Afflicted, Then the Final Outcome Is Theirs"
Rumiyah,9,May-17,Classical Scholar,Ibn al-Qayyim,"Ibnul-Qayyim says in al-Fawaid: In this ayah, there are several wisdoms, secrets, and benefits for the slave. For indeed the slave, when he knows that what he hates could bring what he loves, and that what he loves could bring what he hates, he will not consider himself safe from harm in what gives him joy, nor will he despair of gaining joy from what causes him harm, as he does not know the consequences. And indeed Allah knows what the slave does not know. This necessitates many things. Of them is that there is nothing more beneficial for him than complying with the command, even if that is difficult for him at first. This is because the consequences of doing so are entirely good and come with joy, pleasure, and delight – even if his soul hates it. As such, there is nothing more harmful to him than perpetrating what is prohibited, even if his soul desires it and inclines to it. This is because the consequences of that are entirely bad, causing grief, disturbance, and calamity. And a characteristic of the intellect is being able to bear some small pain in order to achieve the greater delight and abundant good, just as it is able to avoid some small delight because it leads to greater pain and long-term evil. Of the secrets of this ayah is that requires that the slave entrusts in the one who knows the consequences of matters and that he is content with what He chooses and decides for him, as he expects a good outcome for doing so. Of them is that he should not make his own recommendations over what his Lord has chosen for him, nor should he ask Him for that of which he has no knowledge, for it might be that it causes him harm and brings him ruin while he is unaware. Rather, he does not choose anything over his Lord’s decision, but only asks Him to choose what is best for him and asks that He makes him content with what He chooses for him – as there is nothing more beneficial for him than that. Of them is that he entrusts his affair entirely to Allah and is content with whatever He chooses for him, asking Him to give him the strength, resolve, and patience to see it through, that He averts all evils that he might have been exposed to if he were to have made his own decision, and that He shows him the good consequences of what He chose for him over the consequences of what he would have chosen for himself. Of them is that he gives rest to any distressful thoughts regarding the various choices, emptying his heart of all decisions and affairs of management, which would cause him to rise and fall, while he knows that there is no escaping what is decreed for him. Such that if he is content with Allah’s choice, the decree comes to him while he is commendable, thankful, and able to handle it. Otherwise, the decree would come to him while he is distraught and unable to handle it, for that was his own choice. And whenever his entrustment of affairs and contentment are sound, that which was decreed encompasses him with sympathy and favor, such that he abides therein, protected by its sympathy from its dangers and its favor makes what was decreed easy for him to handle. When the decree penetrates the slave, one of its greatest causes of influence over him is what pushes him to reject it. So there is nothing more beneficial to him than surrendering and throwing himself down in front of the decree, as if he were dead. For indeed, the beasts of prey are not content with feasting on corpses. (End quote).",,"And Likewise the Messengers Are Afflicted, Then the Final Outcome Is Theirs"
Rumiyah,9,May-17,Unknown,Taysir al-Aziz al-Hamid fi Sharh Kitab at-Tawhid,"is worship itself, for it is obedience to Allah in accordance with that which He has ordered upon the tongues of His messengers ?, and that he doesn’t obey anyone from among the creation except that this obedience of his falls under Allah’s obedience, otherwise it is not necessary to obey any of the creation independently – and what is meant here is the obedience that is specific to making haram what is halal or making halal what is haram. So whoever obeys a created being in that regard – other than the Messenger g, for he does not speak from his whims – then he is a mushrik, as Allah c made clear in His statement, They have taken their scribes meaning their scholars, and monks meaning their devout worshipers as lords besides Allah, and [also] the Messiah, the son of Mary. And they were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no god except Him. Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Him (At-Tawbah 31). This was explained by the Prophet g as their obedience in making haram what is halal, and making halal what is haram, as will be mentioned in the hadith of Adi. So if it is said that Allah c has stated, O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (An-Nisa 59), then it is said, they are the scholars, and it is said they are the leaders, and these are two explanations reported from Ahmad. Ibnul-Qayyim said, Analysis reveals that the verse encompasses both groups. It is said that it is obligatory to obey them if they command obedience to Allah and obedience to His Messenger. The scholars are conveyers of the orders of Allah and the orders of His Messenger, and those in authority are the executors of those orders, so it then becomes obligatory to obey them in accordance with obedience to Allah and His Messenger, as he g said, There is no obedience in disobedience, rather obedience is in what is righteous’ (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). He g also said, Upon a person is to listen and obey as long as he is not ordered with disobedience, for if he is ordered with disobedience then there is no listening and no obeying.’ Both ahadith are sahih, so there is nothing in this verse that contradicts the verse of Baraah (i.e. At-Tawbah). Ibn Abbas said, Stones are about to rain on you from the sky! I say: Allah’s Messenger g said,’ and you say: Abu Bakr and Umar said?!’’ […] This is what Ibn Abbas said to one who disputed with him regarding combining Hajj and Umrah in the time of Hajj, which Ibn Abbas used to order. The one disputing challenged him with Abu Bakr and Umar’s prohibition of this, implying, They both are more knowledgeable than you [Ibn Abbas] and more deserving of being followed.’ So Ibn Abbas said those words that were pronounced from pure faith and from the absolute nature of his following of Allah’s Messenger g, regardless if anyone opposed him for that – and regardless of who they may be – as ash-Shafi’i said, The scholars have agreed that whoever the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger g has become apparent to, it is not for him to leave it on account of the saying of any other person’ (Madarij as-Salikin). So if that was the saying of Ibn Abbas to the one who opposed him with Abu Bakr and Umar – and they are who they are – what would you expect he would say to one who opposes the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger g with his imam or the founder of his madhhab, which he attributes himself to, and makes his statement a standard of measure over the Quran and Sunnah, such that whatever is in agreement with his madhhab he accepts and whatever opposes it he rejects or reinterprets?! And Allah’s help is sought. And how good is that which was stated by some of the later scholars: So if there came to them evidence in agreement With what the preceding forefathers were upon They’ d be pleased or say, This needs interpretation, And they would go to great lengths to interpret it. And there is no doubt that this falls under the statement of Allah c, They took their scribes and monks as lords besides Allah… (At-Tawbah 31). Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahhab said, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal said, I am amazed at a people who know the authenticity of a chain of narrators, yet they go to the opinion of Sufyan, while Allah c says, So let those beware who dissent from his (i.e. the Prophet’s) order, lest fitnah strike them’ (An-Nur 63). Do you know what that fitnah is? That fitnah is shirk. Perhaps if he were to reject some of his statements there would fall into his heart something of deviance and he would therefore perish.’ This was the statement of Ahmad, reported from him by al-Fadl Ibn Ziyad and Abu Talib. Al-Fadl narrated that Ahmad said, I looked in the Quran and I found [the order to have] obedience to the Messenger in thirty-three places.’ Then he began to recite the verse, So let those beware who dissent from his (i.e. the Prophet’s) order, lest fitnah strike them…’ (An-Nur 63), and he kept on repeating it and said, And what is fitnah except shirk. Perhaps if he were to reject some of his statements there would fall into his heart something of deviance and his heart would become deviated and would destroy him.’ He then began to recite the verse, But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves’ (An-Nisa 65). Abu Talib narrated that it was said to Ahmad, There are people who leave the hadith and turn towards the opinion of Sufyan.’ So he said, I am amazed at a people who have heard the hadith and they know the chain of narrators and its authenticity, yet they leave it and they take the opinion of Sufyan and others. Allah says, So let those beware who dissent from his (i.e. the Prophet’s) order, lest fitnah strike them or a painful punishment afflict them’ (An-Nur 63). And do you know what that fitnah is? It is kufr. Allah c says, And fitnah is greater than killing’ (Al-Baqarah 217). So they leave the hadith from Allah’s Messenger g and their whims overcome them and take them towards opinion.’ This was mentioned by Shaykhul-Islam. I say: The statements of Ahmad in censure of blind following and in denunciation of writing books of opinion are very well-known. His statement, they know the chain of narrators, meaning: the chain of narrators of the hadith, and its authenticity, meaning: the authenticity of the chain of narrators, and its authenticity is an evidence for the authenticity of the hadith. His statement, and they take the opinion of Sufyan, meaning: ath-Thawri, the imam, the zahid, the devout worshiper, the trustworthy, the faqih. He had followers and a popular madhhab, but it didn’t survive. The intent of Ahmad was to denounce the one who knows the authenticity of a hadith, yet after that blindly follows Sufyan or others, and excuses himself with false justifications, such as, following the ahadith is ijtihad, and ijtihad ended a long time ago, or that the imam that I am following is more knowledgeable than me, so he doesn’t speak except with knowledge, and he wouldn’t leave that hadith, for example, except with knowledge, or that this is ijtihad, and the condition for someone to be a mujtahid is that he must be knowledgeable of the Quran and the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger g and of the verses and ahadith which are abrogated as well as those which abrogate them, and be knowledgeable of both the authentic and weak ahadith, and be knowledgeable of the different methods of deriving evidences, and of the Arabic language, grammar, usul, and other such conditions which might not be entirely found in Abu Bakr and Umar ?, as the author mentioned. It is said to such an individual, If this is true, then they intend by this an absolute mujtahid. As for this being a condition for the permissibility of acting upon the Quran and the Sunnah then this is a lie against Allah and His Messenger g, and against the imams of the scholars. Rather, what is obligatory and necessary upon the believer if the [evidence from the] Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger g reach him and he knows its meaning – concerning any issue – is that he act upon it regardless of who opposes him for doing so. This is what our Lord ? ordered us with and likewise our Prophet g, and the scholars – including Abu Umar Ibn Abdil-Barr and others – unanimously agreed on this, but not the ignorant and rough-mannered blind followers, as their likes are not from the people of knowledge, and there is ijma’ that they are not from the people of knowledge. Allah c said, Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies. Little do you remember (Al-A’raf 3). And He c said, And if you obey him, you will be guided. And there is not upon the Messenger except the [responsibility for] clear conveyance (An-Nur 54). So He c testified that the one who obeys the Messenger g is guided. As for the rough-mannered blind followers, they consider that the one who obeys him g is not guided, and that rather the guided one is he who disobeys him and abstains from his sayings and turns away from his Sunnah towards a madhhab or shaykh or other than that. And many people have fallen into this forbidden blind following. They are from among those who claim to have knowledge and understanding of the religion’s principles, and from those who compile books of hadith, but despite that, you find him rigid upon one of the madhahib, considering it a tremendous deal for anyone to leave these madhhabs. In the statement of Ahmad is an indication that blind following before the establishment of proof is not blameworthy. Rather, what is disparaged, condemned, and prohibited is to remain upon that after the proof has been conveyed. Yes, and he denounces turning away from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger g, and embarking upon the study of the complied books of fiqh, sufficing oneself of the Quran and the Sunnah with such books. Rather, even if such people recite something from the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Messenger g, they recite it only for blessings, not for learning or understanding it. And there are those who have read Sahih al-Bukhari, for example, for the purpose of achieving a position of employment, not for the purpose of learning the Shari’ah. So these people are most deserving of being considered as those mentioned in the statement of Allah c, We have certainly given you from Us the Quran. Whoever turns away from it, then indeed, he will bear on the Day of Resurrection a burden, [abiding] eternally therein, and evil it is for them on the Day of Resurrection as a load (Ta Ha 99-101), and likewise His c statement, And whoever turns away from My remembrance, indeed, he will have a depressed life, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind (Ta Ha 124), up to His statement, And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more enduring (Ta Ha 127). So if you ask, Then what is permissible for an individual with regards to reading these books authored about the madhhab? The answer is that it is permissible to read them for the purpose of seeking the help of these books to understand the Quran and Sunnah and to properly conceptualize the issues being studied, such that they become akin to workbooks. But as for these books being made to supersede the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger g, using them to judge between the people on what they differ and calling the people to seek judgment from them instead of seeking judgment from Allah and the Messenger g, then there is no doubt that this negates iman and stands in opposition to it, as He c said, But no, by your Lord, they do not have faith until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort towards what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission (An-Nisa 65). So if you refer to it for judgment of disputes instead of referring to Allah and His Messenger, and then when Allah and His Messenger have decided on a matter you find in yourself discomfort, but when the People of the Book judge on a matter you don’t find any discomfort, then after if the Messenger g judges on a matter you don’t submit to it, yet if they judge on a matter you submit to it, then Allah c has sworn – and He is the most truthful in speech – by the most majestic of those who can be sworn by, and that is Himself ?, that you are not a believer if this is your condition. Thereafter, Allah c has said, Rather, man, against himself, will be a witness, even if he presents his excuses (Al-Qiyamah 14-15).",,They Took Their Scribes and Monks as Lords Besides Allah

Rumiyah,4,Dec-16,Unknown,Umar Ibn Mahmud Abu Umar: Bayn Manhajayn,"One of these ruwaybidah (pathetic persons too sluggish or feeble to achieve great matters) was truthful, though still a liar, when he said, The Sunnah praising the referral to books without taking individuals and role models into consideration is the definite proof supporting the favorers of books. This proof is his ? statement, when he said to his companions one day, Which of creation, according to you, is most amazing in iman?’ They said, The angels.’ He said, But how could they not believe while they are with their Lord?’ They said, Then the prophets.’ He said, How could they not believe when they are given revelation?’ They said, Then us.’ He said, How could you not believe whilst I am in your midst?’ They said, Then who, O Messenger of Allah?’ He said, A people coming after you, finding some pages in which they believe.’ Another wording has, Rather a people coming after you, receiving a book between two tablets, which they believe in and the contents of which they act upon. Their reward shall be greater than yours.’ Another wording has, They find fastened pages and act according to their contents; thus, they are the best people in faith.’1 This narration, in its clarity, commends the taking of knowledge through fastened pages.’ Rather, he made those who do so the greatest of people in reward and the most excellent of them in faith. This shows that returning to books is the path for salvation when times change for the worse and are filled with the evil of corrupt role models who wrongly and deceptively claim the honor of knowledge and scholarship. The nonconformist’ individuals who return to books then should pay no heed to the words and opinions of so-and-so and so-and-so, as no one would abandon the shar’i paths for the heretical ones except out of ignorance, incapacity, or corruption, as Ibn Taymiyyah has stated. This path of taking knowledge from fastened pages’ is a shar’i path that prevents the scholar’s errors from leaping into the mind of the follower and settling therein under the guise of infallibility and religion (Umar Ibn Mahmud Abu Umar: Bayn Manhajayn).",,"Whoever Takes His Book As His Teacher Will Be More Correct Than Mistaken, If...."
